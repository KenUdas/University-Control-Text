    <h2 class="calibre9">XI. Letters from Colleges for Women</h2>

    <p>My experience with a college faculty is such that I am obliged to believe that the less work of administrative character entrusted to persons actively engaged in teaching, the better. I do not know any more impracticable set of people than are brought together in a college faculty, and I have come to regard our American system in which an almost autocratic control is vested in the president in all administrative matters as the best under the circumstances. It is not an ideal arrangement, but is the lesser evil.</p>

    <p>If there is to be a president in the plan of university control, he should, it seems to me, be given scope for the exercise of expert knowledge of education and university administration, otherwise there will be no inducement for a man possessing such qualifications to accept the office. If the president were a member of the board of advisers, replacing one of the two professors from related departments, the general interests of the university would have a hearing. I am a little dubious about the wisdom of admitting two experts from the outside to this board. The plan deserves a trial and certainly avoids many of the present evils.</p>

    <p>Your reprint on university control contains suggestions that look promising in view of the present dearth of men qualified to be university presidents of the type now standard. But it presupposes competent trustees and deans. It seems to me that it would work better for small institutions than for large ones at present: between our larger universities the rivalries are too keen for a pure democracy to conduct, and a president or a mikado as central executive and schemer is indispensable. Paragraph (1). The scheme is ideal (i. e., admirable) but lacks apparently any reciprocal control or check as between business members and academic members. Paragraph (2). This "president" is a "dean"; he ought to have a larger salary because he must bear more trivial annoyances and must forego more of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page186" title="186"></span>pursuits that are attractive to scholars than the other professors. Paragraphs (3) and (5). These indicate practises now more or less prevalent, and point out well the size of convenient divisions. Paragraph (4). This section I approve in toto. It is workable, however, only at a stage well advanced in the evolution of a strong institution, where the professors are competent and public-spirited. For institutions burdened with incompetence or with graft, the prescription should be a chancellor with autocratic powers, for the reasons stated by Sir William Hamilton in his report on German universities.</p>

    <p>I wholly approve the principle and many of the details of the plan of university control proposed in your paper. My greatest question is whether general matters— e. g., curriculum, dormitory and commons administration in a residential university—would receive sufficient attention on a plan with such emphasis on the division or department unit. But the proper development of the senate might secure this.</p>

    <p>What I especially like about this or any similar scheme is that it involves the rescue of the professor from the position of a mere "hand" in the university machinery and the placing of him in such a relation that he is made to bear and to feel his share in the welfare of the entire institution. Instead of being made to feel a sort of truckling dependence upon the "powers," his own independent dignity and self-respect will be aroused and enhanced. Having his part in the responsibility for the whole, he is to that extent responsible for the status of his own position. I agree entirely with the statement of the circular, that the establishing of this plan must be the outcome of a slowly evolving change.</p>

    <p>Your suggested plan of university control seems to me admirable and calculated to obviate many of the evils of the present system, which are very grave. The only criticism that occurred to me as I read it concerns the method of nominating professors. I am not sure whether a department can be trusted to nominate its own professors, even although approval and final election are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page187" title="187"></span>by bodies containing members chosen from outside the department. It is so often to the private interests of the members of a department to choose a colleague of mediocre ability. And if the nominating were done wholly by the department the merely negative influence of the board of advisers might not be sufficient to secure the best men.</p>

    <p>I am heartily in agreement with you on the need of reorganizing our universities and also on most of the suggestions you offer. Decentralization appears to me necessary; and the creation of a chancellor elected by a corporation representing the community, the alumni and the teaching body; of a president elected by the professors or their representatives; and, further, the granting of certain powers to university departments—all seem to me measures that would go far towards correcting the evils of the present autocratic system of government. I notice with satisfaction that you give a share in the nomination of professors to outside experts and to professors of other university departments than the one to which the nominees belong.</p>

    <p>The present methods in common use for managing institutions in this country are quite as complete a failure as our city governments. Without going back to the slovenly rawness of American life in general as the real basis, we may say that the piddling incompetence of faculties is responsible for the prominence of such damned scoundrels as ---- and ----. ---- is another one that ought to be in jail. Harvard hasn't been run that way—it couldn't be because the faculty is too good. Eliot never bossed; he persuaded and it took him years to do it sometimes. The one thing most needed is to adopt the English system of appointing professors and so stop the inbreeding which is the bane of all our universities. Your scheme looks all right but the scheme is not important. Get good men on the faculty and the president won't have the mental and moral force to do any harm. In closing these somewhat sketchy remarks—which I hardly think you will care to quote in full!—I may say that I may be quite wrong about the unimportance of the machinery and that if you are willing to take the trouble to try to suggest practical and practicable improvements you have my hearty sympathy.</p>
