    <h2 class="UC_heading2">IV. The Position of The Professor</h2>

    <p>The Bible is often misquoted to the effect that "money is the root of all evil." The love of money and the lack of money are indeed factors in most of the difficulties of society. Next after the getting of men, the getting of money for the university is its most troublesome problem, and next after the proper treatment of men, the use of money is the most important question. He who holds the purse strings holds the reins of power. That the president should decide which professor shall be discharged and which have his salary advanced, which department or line of work shall be favored or crippled, is the most sinister side of our present system of university administration, more pernicious in the private universities, where dismissals and salaries are kept secret, than in the state universities, where salaries are published and teachers are, or should be, dismissed, as in the better public-school systems, only after definite charges.</p>

    <p>To transfer the control of appointments and finances from the president to the professors would strike many as passing from purgatory to a worse place. A university executive said to me the other day that if the professors were in control the first thing that they would do would be to raise their own salaries. Well, perhaps worse things have been done. It may be admitted that this is what a president usually does for himself and to an extent beyond the dreams of the most avaricious professor. But there are at least two points of difference. First, the president may increase his salary by withholding a small sum from each professor, whereas the professors could only increase their salaries by obtaining the money for the purpose. Second, it is undesirable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page37" title="37"></span>for a president to receive three or four times the salary of the greatest scholar or teacher on the faculty, as is the case at California, Columbia and other institutions. It is subversive of decent social and educational ideals for the president of Harvard University to be permitted to build on the grounds of the university a house for himself costing $100,000, and for the trustees of Columbia University to build for their president a house which with its grounds may cost twice that amount. But it would be in the interest of the university and of society if the salaries of professors were increased. Abuses are possible, but at present whatever makes the academic career more attractive to men of genius is in the interest of all the people.</p>

    <p>The undeniable difficulties in the way of adjusting salaries and the conflicting needs of schools and departments, whether the decision rests primarily with the president, the trustees or a committee of the faculties, may be minimized by permanence of tenure and fixed salaries, and by giving the departments financial autonomy. President Van Hise, of the University of Wisconsin, and President Butler, of Columbia University, have recently pronounced in favor of the competitive system in the university.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c04_note01" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c04_note01">1</a> The former says: "There is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page38" title="38"></span>no possible excuse for retaining in the staff of a university an inefficient man." The latter says: "A teacher who can not give to the institution which maintains him common loyalty and the kind of service which loyalty implies ought not to be retained through fear of clamor or criticism," and further in respect to equality of salaries: "In my judgment such a policy would fill the university with mediocrities and render it impossible to make that special provision for distinction and for genius which the trustees ought always to be able to make."</p>

    <p>There are advantages in a system of severe competition for large prizes under honorable conditions, as well as in permanent tenure of office with small salaries and a free life; but confusion and harm result from running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. If there is to be competition in order to retain university chairs, then the university must be prepared to forego able men or to compete with other professions in the rewards it gives. It must offer prizes commensurate with those of engineering, medicine and law, namely, salaries as large as from ten to a hundred thousand dollars a year. It is further true that under these circumstances a man must be judged by his peers. A university which dismisses professors when the president thinks that they are inefficient or lacking in loyalty to him is parasitic on the great academic traditions of the past and of other nations.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page39" title="39"></span> A single university which acts in this way will in the end obtain a faculty consisting of a few adventurers, a few sycophants and a crowd of mediocrities. If all universities adopt such a policy, while retaining their present meager salaries and systems of autocratic control, then able men will not embark on such ill-starred ships. They will carry forward scientific work in connection with industry and will attract as apprentices those competent to learn the ways of research.</p>

    <p>Permanent tenure of office for the professor is not a unique state of privilege. A president 's wife has permanent tenure of office; he can not dismiss her because he regards her as inefficient or because he prefers another woman. Analogous social conditions make it undesirable that he should have power to dismiss a professor for similar reasons. In the army and navy, in the highest courts, to a certain extent in the civil service of every country, there is permanence of office. Indeed it is nowhere completely disregarded; service is always a valid claim for continued employment. A wife may be divorced by the courts, an army officer may be court-martialed, a judge may be impeached; but such actions are taken only after definite charges and opportunity for defence. Permanent tenure of office is intended to improve the service, not to demoralize it. It is attached to honorable offices, where public spirit and self-sacrifice are demanded, and the wages do not measure the performance. In Germany, France and Great Britain the permanence of tenure has given dignity and honor to the university chair, attracting to it the ablest men and setting them free to do their work.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c04_note02" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c04_note02">2</a></p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page40" title="40"></span>Incitement to the best work of which a man is capable is not excluded from the university if the professorship itself is made a high reward, the essentials of which are permanence, freedom and honor. Men who have proved their ability for research need opportunity rather than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page41" title="41"></span>extraneous stimulus. Still it is true that while the lack of prizes does not considerably dampen the spirit of research, it makes the academic career less attractive to those who should be drawn to it. Most of the graduate students in our universities are men of mediocre ability, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page42" title="42"></span>drifting along with the aid of fellowships and underpaid assistantships to an inglorious Ph.D. and a profession with meager rewards. Several of my correspondents write that if large income, power and honor were not attached to the presidency, there would be no prize to attract men to university work. From my point of view it is altogether demoralizing that the reward held before the investigator and teacher should be the position of an executive, politician and promoter, which takes him away from the higher work for which he is fit. It is a curious exposure of the situation when the president of our largest university can write:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation">Almost without exception the men who to-day occupy the most conspicuous positions in the United States have worked their way up, by their own ability, from very humble beginnings. The heads of the great universities were every one of them not long ago humble and poorly compensated teachers.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c04_note03" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c04_note03">3</a></blockquote>

    <p>It would be well if some universities would maintain professorships so highly rewarded and regarded that the possibility of a call would exercise a beneficial influence throughout the country, and if each university would establish from one to ten professorships having a salary and a prestige equal at least to that of the presidency.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c04_note04" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c04_note04">4</a> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page43" title="43"></span>Vacancies in these professorships should be filled by cooptation or election by the faculties or by a faculty committee; but even under the present system of presidential nominations, it would be better to have a few important appointments made publicly than a number of small increases in salary made secretly as the result of presidential favor.</p>

    <p>It is awkward to urge a reform, such as an increase in the salaries of professors or the advance of a few salaries to that of the presidency, when this would become superfluous or undesirable, if society as a whole could be reorganized on a just economic basis. Elsewhere<a class="super_original" id="p01_c04_note05" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c04_note05">5</a> I have discussed the question as follows:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation">The best reward for scholarly work is adequate recognition of the work as preparation for a career in life. At Columbia University a man takes his doctor's degree at the average age of 27 years. He is fortunate if he receives immediately an instructor-ship at $1,000 a year; the increments of salary are $100 a year for ten years, so that at the age of 37 he receives a salary of $2,000. In a commercial community the imagination is not stirred by such figures. The university is a parasite on the scholarly impulse instead of a stimulus to it.
<br/><br/>
The first need of our universities and colleges is great men for teachers. In order that the best men may be drawn to the academic career, it must be attractive and honorable. The professorship was inherited by us as a high office which is now being lowered. Professors and scholars are not sufficiently free or sufficiently well paid, so there is a lack of men who deserve to be highly rewarded, and we are in danger of sliding down the lines of a vicious spiral, until we reach the stage where the professor and his scholarship are not respected because they are not respectable. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page44" title="44"></span>
<br/><br/>
I should myself prefer to see the salaries, earnings and conveyings of others cut down rather than to have the salaries of professors greatly increased. When a criminal lawyer—to use the more inclusive term for corporation lawyer—receives a single fee of $800,000, our civilization is obviously complicated. Every professor who is as able as this lawyer and who does work more important for society can not be paid a million dollars a year. But neither is it necessary to pay him so little that he can not do his work or educate his children. I recently excused myself somewhat awkwardly for not greeting promptly the wife of a colleague by saying that men could not be expected to recognize women because they changed their frocks. She replied: "The wives of professors don't." It is better to have wit than frocks; but in the long run they are likely to be found together.
<br/><br/>
The first step of a really great university president would be to refuse to accept a larger salary than is paid to the professors. The second step would be to make himself responsible to the faculty instead of holding each professor responsible to him. The bureaucratic or department-store system of university control is the disease which is now serious and may become fatal. This subjection of the individual to the machinery of administration and to the rack wage is but an invasion of the university by methods in business and in politics from which the whole country suffers. We may hope that it is only a temporary incident in the growth of material complexity beyond the powers of moral and intellectual control, and that man may soon regain his seat in the saddle.</blockquote>

    <p>I myself accept the social ideal: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs; and I believe that, thanks to the applications of science, the resources of society are sufficient to provide adequately for all. But the first step to take in our present competitive system is to make rewards commensurate with effective ability and a compromise between services and needs. I have pointed out that, apart from exceptional cases, the range of individual differences in many traits is about as two to one. Thus in accuracy of perception and movement,<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page45" title="45"></span> in quickness of recognition and reaction, in rate of learning and retentiveness of memory, in time and variety of the association of ideas, in validity of judgments, I have found in laboratory experiments a range of difference of this magnitude. The able student can prepare a lesson or earn the doctor's degree in about half the time required by the poorer student. For the same kind of work and under similar conditions the value of the services of an individual varies within somewhat the same limits. A good laboring man or a good clerk is worth as much as two who are mediocre. The value of genius to the world is of course inestimable. A great man of science may contribute more than even the most successful promoter—a Rockefeller, a Carnegie or a Morgan—gets. But such contributions are made possible by the organization of society as a whole, and should in large measure be distributed among its members, preferably in the direction of making further contributions possible. Scientific men should receive adequate rewards, and the surplus wealth which directly or indirectly they have produced—it must be counted by the hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars—should, in so far as this can be done to advantage, be spent on further scientific research.</p>

    <p>The available wealth in the United States and Great Britain suffices to provide a home and the tools of production for each family and the productivity of labor to provide an annual income of about $1,000 for each producer. If waste in production and expenditure were reduced, even to the extent that now obtains among teachers and scientific men as a group, there would probably be available $1,500 for each adult, including women engaged in the care of the home, or $3,000 for each family. If this were distributed on a range of two to one in accordance with ability, the more deserving teachers<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page46" title="46"></span> and scientific men with their wives would earn salaries of $4,000, in addition to owning their homes. An addition of from $250 to $1,000 should be allowed for each child requiring support and education, to be deducted in part from the incomes of those having no children, and allowance should be made for the varying cost of living in the city or the country and the like.</p>

    <p>If the maximum income of a university professor or scientific man with a family should be from $5,000 to $10,000, no one should receive more, except to cover greater risks. There is no occupation requiring rarer ability or more prolonged preliminary training, and there is none whose services to society are greater. If there are to be money prizes—incomes of $20,000 or $100,000 or more—then they should be open to professors and investigators. Scientific ability is as rare as executive or legal ability, and is far more valuable to society. The lawyer who receives a fee of $800,000 for enabling a group of promoters to get ten times as much by evading the intent of the law, does not add to the wealth of society. The scientific man who increases the yield of the cereal crop by one per cent, adds $10,000,000 a year to the wealth of the country and five times as much to the wealth of the world. The scientific man who discovered and those who have developed the Bessemer process of making steel have, according to the estimate of Abram S. Hewitt, added $2,000,000,000 yearly to the world's wealth. There is no reason except the imperfect adjustments of society why the lawyer should receive large rewards and the scientific man a scant salary. Those who render services to an individual or group are likely to be paid in accordance with the value of their services to the individual or group; in our competitive system those who render services to society as a whole are not paid at all, or only partially and indirectly. Of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page47" title="47"></span>our thousand leading men of science, 738 are employed in universities and colleges, 106 in the government service, 59 in research foundations. It is the duty of these institutions to provide adequately and liberally for their support and for their work.</p>

    <p>The rewards of the academic and scientific career deserve detailed discussion because they are of fundamental importance to the university and to society. Professors and investigators should have adequate incomes, as large as is desirable for any social class, but above all they should have opportunity to lead a life free from distracting or dishonorable compromises. It should be emphasized that nothing here written is intended to promote a privileged class of university professors. Valparaiso University and Mr. Edison's Menlo Park Laboratory are useful, as well as Harvard University and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. My concern is only that the university should be of the greatest possible service to the people and to the world. It may be that the great bulk of routine teaching and routine research can be done most economically under the factory system, with a manager to employ and discharge the instructional force and bosses to keep each gang up to a square day's work. But then the highest productive scholarship and creative research must find refuge elsewhere than in such a university.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c04_note06" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c04_note06">6</a></p>

    <p>It is truly distressing that our universities should be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page48" title="48"></span>so conventional and unimaginative, each trying to follow the lead of those bigger than itself, all lacking in fineness and distinction. The Johns Hopkins, Clark, Stanford and Chicago were founded one after the other with promise of higher things, and each has relapsed into the common mediocrity. Harvard and Yale maintain the traditions of scholarship; the Johns Hopkins and Chicago have not abandoned the ideals of research; Columbia looms up with the vastness and crudeness of the metropolis; the state universities exhibit the promise and the immaturity of our democracy. But each and all unite the scholasticism of the twelfth century with the commercial rawness of the twentieth century. Can there not be one university where the professor will have a study instead of an office, where the ideal set before the young instructor is something else than answering letters promptly and neatly on the typewriter, where men are weighed rather than counted, where efficiency and machinery are subordinated to the personality of great men? Could there not be a university or school, dominating some field of scholarship and research with its half-dozen professors and group of instructors and students drawn together by them? Might not means be devised by which the professor would be paid for the value of his teaching, service and research, and then be set free to do his work how and when and where he can do it best? It is not inconceivable that there should be a national or state university, with some features of the royal academies, rewarding with fellowships men of unusual promise and with professorships men of unusual performance, endowing the individual instead of the institution.</p>
