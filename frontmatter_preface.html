    <p>The substance of the essay on university control and the collection of letters from university professors were  prepared for the faculties of the University of Illinois and for discussion before their committee charged with drawing up a constitution for the university. Papers on the subject were also presented at about the same time before the Society of the Sigma Xi of the University of  Indiana, the Huxley Club of the Johns Hopkins University and at a joint meeting of the faculties of Lehigh University and Lafayette College. The fact that in the last two cases the presentation was in the form of an after-dinner address may account for the more frivolous and rhetorical passages and for the use of the first personal pronoun. These might have been eliminated—they have been reduced—but a reformer should be concerned with accomplishing his ends rather than with conserving his dignity.
</p>

    <p>The articles on university control forming the third part of the volume are reprinted with the consent of the authors and of the editors and publishers of the journals in which they originally appeared. The unsigned letters from university and college professors exhibit the actual diversity of opinion which exists; all the articles advocate reforms in somewhat the same direction. Consideration was given to the inclusion of articles lauding or defending the autocratic system of administration which has developed in our universities. No such article, however, appears to have been written by a professor, though a number of articles and two books of that kind have been published by university presidents.</p>

    <p>  <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="pagevi" title="vi"></span>The essay, the letters and the series of articles are printed in book form after some hesitation. They are obviously a protest against conditions and tendencies, the  existence of which can not be denied and should not be concealed. But the book is intended to be an effort for construction, not an exhibition of complaint and criticism. Of the historic institutions—<span xml:lang="la" lang="it">Sacerdotium, Imperium, Studium</span>—the university can in our democracy best conserve the traditions of the past and guide the progress of the future. It is a great heritage which we should use wisely and transmit unimpaired.
