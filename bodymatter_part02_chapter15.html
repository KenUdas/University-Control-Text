    <h2 class="calibre9">XV. Letters from the Universities of Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri and California</h2>

    <p>I not agree with the policies advocated in your pamphlet entitled "University Control." I regard the existing system of American university administration not only as a development resting on historical conditions, but as generally satisfactory. I believe that ultimate responsibility should rest, not with interested employees, but with disinterested trustees in the literal sense of that term. The success of any institution, of course, rests as much with its employees, who do the actual work, as with the trustees, who determine its policy. The two bodies therefore need a connecting means and, at the same time, a buffer. This difficult and delicate position is filled by the American university president, who is in touch with both bodies. If the actual powers of the president are great, it is normally only because he is able. I do not believe that university freedom is often invaded either by president or trustees. As professors have not been able to unite for defense in those cases where their privileges and liberty are said to have been infringed, I think it is clear that they would not be able to cooperate harmoniously and efficiently in the transaction of every-day business. I believe that a system of complete faculty control would lead to the demoralization of our universities.</p>

    <p>(1) The corporation mentioned I should consider as too large and too heterogeneous to be of much value in managing the affairs of a university. (2) The choice of president by the faculty I should consider a very unwise move and not at all free from the evils of the present system. Members of faculties are not free from bias, for very selfish reasons. No president worthy of the name would undertake the duties at a salary no better than that of a member of the staff. A president with no power is no president at all in my judgment. (3), (4) The subdivision into autonomous parts I consider the worst defect of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page223" title="223"></span>the scheme. It would increase the jealousy naturally existing now in the various parts of large institutions, would lead to lack of coordination in the work of the whole institution, and would be a case of the survival of the shrewdest. The selection of members of a faculty by the faculty, I do not consider at all an improvement over the present methods. With the exception of men who are prominent already in their respective lines, I do not think the average faculty has any better knowledge of their fitness than has a good college president. The president is usually free from internal jealousy in at least departments other than his own. The under men in a department would also have a tendency to shut out men likely to be promoted over them. In brief I do not like the anarchy you propose. As a member of a university faculty I should much prefer to be under even the absolute domination of one man, the president, than under the chaotic rule that I think would result from the plan you propose. I firmly believe that any organization must have a single dominating head big enough to really control it. My observation of faculty meetings and such service as I have had on college committees do not incline me to the belief that for administration and college policy the faculty, as a whole, is as competent as a few or one selected individual.</p>

    <p>In my judgment there is a place and a need for the modern university president, although the right man for the place may sometimes be hard to find. I do not approve of the plan of having two heads to the university, as you suggest—namely, a chancellor and also a president. I doubt if the power of nominating the president should be placed in the hands of the professors, for, after all, university professors are usually specialists with a narrower view of what a public-service institution should be than is possessed by many leaders in business and state affairs. If the trustees are well educated, patriotic men, fairly representing the territory to be served by the university, then I think they are more capable of selecting a president than are the professors. Such a body consisting of twelve or fifteen members, elected by the people of the state or by the alumni of the institution, with freedom to counsel with the leading officers and professors of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page224" title="224"></span>university, probably constitutes the best board of control. I do not believe that the school or college is as capable of selecting its dean or director as is the president and board of trustees. Any self-controlled and self-perpetuating body, supported at public expense, is too likely to become a mutual-admiration society, which may forget or fail to discover its duties to the public. I do not think that professors should be appointed for life, but rather for efficient service; and I think a professor's employment should terminate whenever another man can be found who can fill the place with distinctly greater efficiency. I think, however, that the university should pay reasonably and in full for the service rendered, so that the professor can not feel when his successor is appointed that the institution still owes him employment and remuneration to the end of life. The system adopted ought not to be one that will tend to load the university with dead timber. The university professor, the same as other people, should learn to live within his income and to lay by for future needs. If he can not do this he ought not to complain about it, but rather to seek employment in other lines, for the university is not an institution for private charity, but for public service.</p>

    <p>I believe there is need in the large institutions, as well as in the smaller ones, of some individual whose duty it shall be to study carefully all the relations of university life and form the central point around which the administrative work of the university is grouped. The position is of such extreme importance that it demands the very best ability that can be secured, and demands also that the person who holds this position shall give to it his entire attention without any distraction in the direction of the care of a department or in class-room work. Under these conditions it seems to me that our American system of a president for a university is better than a system of frequent change in this office, and because of the large interests involved and the necessity of securing the very highest ability available a larger salary than is paid to professors must be paid to secure the right man, though it is of course a question as to whether the difference has not become too great in many of our American <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page225" title="225"></span>universities. Next to the president there should be a compact group of perhaps half a dozen advisers, whom it should be the duty of the president to consult in regard to matters of large university policy, which can not well be submitted to a larger group, including all professors in the university. In the case of such a university as ours the group consisting of the deans of the several colleges would seem to be appropriate for this function. Below this group and within each college there should, I think, be a similar small group who would consult with the dean of the particular college as to matters immediately pertaining to that college. Again within each department the head of the department or the chairman, according to whatever system of organization is adopted, should consult with the members of the department in regard to matters of importance. For some purposes all members of the staff in a given department should be brought together, but questions with regard to salaries and promotions should be always considered first in a group sufficiently small, so that personal considerations, which are so important, may be discussed freely. Such a discussion is, of course, impossible in a meeting of many individuals together. The above is only a very rough sketch of organization, and requires very much filling in of details, but two things, I think, must be secured in any effective organization of a university. (1) The individual professor must be relieved as far as possible from attendance upon faculty meetings, which are time-consuming and frequently ineffective. (2) There must be small, compact groups of individuals upon whom is placed the responsibility of organization and conduct of the affairs of the university; and these men must be so chosen that they will give the necessary time for careful consideration of the important, general problems committed to their care.</p>

    <p>In general, I should characterize the plan as containing valuable suggestion rather than one which might be considered the ideal for any one institution. The problem of the state university seems sufficiently different from that of the endowed university to make some radical differences necessary. The plan should be extended, I think, to include some indication as to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page226" title="226"></span>administration of funds, particularly as to their apportionment among the various departments. I believe quite thoroughly in the faculty control of all matters of purely educational nature. But the powers given by your plan to faculties or sub-groups of faculties seem to me in some cases too great. For instance, anything like the elective selection of professors might be dangerous. I should fear too much tendency on the part of men ambitious for professorships to ingratiate themselves with the nominating or electing bodies, or rather with the individuals of those bodies, so that professorships would be sought by activities political in nature rather than by the endeavor to prove oneself qualified as a teacher or investigator for the position. I think that a larger responsibility of deans and other administrators to faculties desirable, but I seriously question whether this can be most wisely attained by electing these officers. Nor do I feel that election furnishes the best method of choosing committees. The reason is simple. A responsible dean or head is free to consult with individuals as to his appointments, and can take into account all sorts of matters connected with qualifications connected with the office or committee membership to which appointment is to be made. An electing body can not, as a matter of experience, so freely discuss suggested appointees. To reinforce my opinion, I may call attention to a situation which has existed in nearly every body of which I have been a member, and a situation which I imagine to be general. It is, that in nearly every case in which a motion is made involving a committee it is of the form: "I move that a committee be appointed," or ''I move that the chair appoint a committee." Only infrequently is the individual membership determined by election. And this in spite of the fact that in the majority of cases the motions might have been framed to make the committees elective.</p>

    <p>Regarding (1) I would call attention to the fact that in a number of states the form of the governing body and its method of selection is prescribed by the constitution of the state. Since amendment to the constitution is becoming increasingly difficult or impossible—as it appears to be in this state—this recommendation would apply, if at all, only as an academic ideal. (2) I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page227" title="227"></span>can not see that a man with the specified qualifications would be likely to accept the type of position described. (3), (4) There can be no doubt that membership in a small faculty carries with it a sense of responsibility. Whether such groups could be formed in which the work could be understood reasonably by all members, I do not know. Doubtless many instances would arise in which groups of the size indicated would be possible only at the sacrifice of the sort of understanding implied—in which, for example, the election of minor teachers by the whole group could not be performed intelligently. Doubtless the provision that the same salaries be paid for the same office will appeal strongly to those who have suffered under the other system. The "same salary" system has, however, defects of its own, which are most painfully clear to those who have lived under it. The main defect is that it seems impossible to recognize eminent service or remarkable attainment by any plan other than the imposition of new duties. (5) The main insistence should, in my opinion, be upon the footnote No. 9. The tendency to create more and more administrative machinery seems to be quite general and it is most deplorable.</p>

    <p>I am glad to express my approval, in the main, of your proposed system of university control. It seems to me, however, that, during the evolution period at any rate, if not permanently, it would be advisable to retain some of the advantages of the autocratic system, by introducing the veto principle into the system of government. University faculties, like other bodies, are not infrequently prone to act upon questions hastily or without having given the matter sufficient thought. The veto power in the hands of the administrative officer, or body, would act as a check upon evils of this nature, for a faculty would be slow to override (say by a two-thirds vote) the veto of an administrative officer who possessed its respect and confidence and such an action would come only after careful consideration and a conviction that its own judgment was the better.</p>

    <p>I am heartily in sympathy with this plan in its broader outlines. I feel very certain that it is in the right direction, that is, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page228" title="228"></span>in the direction of the kind of a change which is sorely needed in the administrative organization of our universities. There are two or three items which I either have doubts about or do not agree with, for example, in paragraph (2), your suggestion is, that the president, to be elected by the professors or officers or their representatives, should have a salary not larger than the salary of the professor. I should need convincing argument to subscribe to this. I do not think his salary should be out of all proportion, as is now sometimes the case, but it seems to me that there are certain responsibilities and burdens which make a larger demand upon the energies and that would more continuously occupy the thoughts of such a president, to the exclusion of other matters to which he might prefer to give his attention, and that there ought to be some additional compensation on this account. He should receive more than a professor for similar reasons (in part) that a professor should receive more than an instructor, or an instructor more than a laboratory assistant. This would not apply to the kind of president that we have now, that is, men presumably choosing a presidency as a profession by willingly laying down other work, such as teaching or investigation, because executive work makes a stronger appeal. In paragraph (4) your proposition is, that "the same salary should be paid for the same office and the same amount of work." I am not in a position to agree that this is desirable. Taking the statement at its face value, it puts remuneration on a quantitative rather than a qualitative basis. Two "head professors" in a given university might put in the same number of hours of work and might publish the same number of papers, or number of pages of contributions, or other writings during the year, and yet the work of one be much inferior in its value to the university and to the advancement of knowledge in general. In such a circumstance, it seems to me that one professor is really worth more to the university than the other and should accordingly be paid more. Of course, I do not mean to imply by this that I think any two men could ever be appraised at precisely equivalent value, or that identical salaries would imply this. You are of course familiar with all the arguments that have recently been published with reference to a similar proposition of "equal pay for equal work" in the school <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page229" title="229"></span>situation in New York. I feel that your suggestion in paragraph (4) relating to experts outside the university is especially good. In fact, I have felt that it would be desirable for universities to have something like a board of educational directors, made up of members of the faculty, of the alumni, of local business men not connected with the university in any way, and two or three members of other universities, which should have the consideration, and possibly the final decision, in questions of educational policy. Perhaps the senate which you suggest in paragraph (5) could to advantage have some such composition as this.</p>

    <p>On the whole, I am very much in sympathy with your ideas as expressed in the article "University Control" but realize perhaps more keenly than you do that to reach such an ideal, which is a combination of the German and British systems, there must be many intermediate steps, depending, as stated above, upon environment and personnel. An organization or method which would be useful to one set of conditions and individuals might be absolutely impossible in another institution, even though both were aiming at your ultimate ideal, which has for its object provision for the greatest freedom in the development of the individual as well as departmental and university efficiency. In any ultimate analysis, departmental and university efficiency will quarrel with personal freedom. You have summed up the whole matter in your pamphlet in the last sentence of footnote 5, page 3, where you say: "Security, permanence, honor, the slow growth of traditions, are essential to a true university." This means that there is a final substitution of organic law, rules and regulations, traditions and precedents for the autocracy of presidents, deans and departmental heads. I believe that this transition will ultimately occur, but feel sure it is better to have an autocratic American system of presidents and deans in the earlier development of our universities, than to attempt to protect individual freedom of action of autocratic and frequently erratic and visionary professors, where our institutions have not the elements of cohesion supplied by traditions, precedents, laws, etc., which safeguard the older institutions and at the same time interfere with easy adaptation to new social, economic or educational de-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page230" title="230"></span>mands. A suggestion in regard to your university corporation consisting of alumni, which is the Cambridge, England, plan, may be worth while. Would it not perhaps be wise to limit the university corporation, consisting of alumni, to second-degree men, such as M.A., M.D., etc.? I see that you have provided for their payment of fees. The system of compounding annual fees is arranged at Cambridge, England. This is based upon life expectancy, I think. It should be remembered that in state universities, such as Minnesota, alumni do band themselves together, taking life membership in the alumni association and through its officers, committees, etc., make themselves responsible for securing desirable legislation along general lines, such as increased appropriations, etc. Our alumni association is represented on our university council, on the athletic board of control, and certain alumni were appointed as such on the board of regents by the governor of the state.</p>

    <p>This is a subject in which I am particularly interested, as we have the question of better university organization under consideration at the present time. Our new president, George E. Vincent, is a man of very democratic tendencies and believes in team work to the fullest extent. Our university council, which is now a representative council, is planned to be reorganized on the basis of including all the deans and professors in the various departments, organized as a university senate, the president of the university being the president of the senate and the deans of the colleges a sort of executive council. The matter is not yet fully worked out, but something along this line must certainly come in university administration. The day of one-man control of institutions of learning, or of scientific institutions or bureaus, is past, never to return. The exact form in which this more democratic organization should be undertaken is of course a question which will depend somewhat upon local conditions.</p>

    <p>There are many excellent features in your plan of university control. The central idea, representative basis, is correct. Special features should be added to your plan to meet the normal conditions existing in some state universities so as to completely <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page231" title="231"></span>eliminate politics. A large portion of the time and energy of the presidents of some state universities is necessarily spent in catering to popular "calls" so as to aid in securing appropriations. Presidents are even "rated" on their ability "to get" funds from legislatures. For a young institution this is in part excusable, but the habit once formed seems to cling long after the necessity ceases. This spirit extends to the professors and they often feel that they must offer so-called "popular courses" so as to aid in securing funds. This in turn leads to tin-horn work, and when the funds are secured often the modest, scholarly, deserving professor receives a mere pittance for his department, and the professor doing "showy work" gets the lion's share. College extension work is commendable, but it should be kept distinct from serious college instruction. This catering to the public and "popularizing" universities is in danger of being overdone and affecting the moral aspect of the work. Students, quick of perception, readily imitate "show work," and formulate wrong moral standards. The welfare of a university is the safest in the hands of a carefully selected and reasonably well paid faculty. The faculty and president should establish the educational standard of the university. Some colleges have too many professors and not enough assistant professors and instructors. Faculties should be carefully selected with the view of getting men who will work in harmony and men broad enough to forget individualism and to work for the common good of the institution. As to the president, he should be ripe in scholarship or at least capable of appreciating ripe scholarship. He should not be hampered by a dictatorial governing board, neither should he be autocratic in his relations to professors. The professor in an institution should stand in the same relationship as a director in a large business organization—not performing the functions of a manager or president, but assisting him to promote the welfare of the institution. The trusteeship of the college should concern itself largely with the financial management and affairs of the institution, and not attempt to perform the functions of president or faculty. And finally there should be some way of securing men for trusteeship so as to eliminate politics as largely as possible. That such conditions do exist is suggestive of a recent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page232" title="232"></span>grand-jury report of Hennepin County, Minneapolis, where the University of Minnesota is situated, when a shortage in accounts was investigated. "Your committee farther recommends that all moneys derived from any source whatever be deposited with the state treasurer; also that all appointments to the board of regents be made on the basis of personal fitness rather than on the basis of interchange of political courtesies." Without commenting upon the merits or demerits of this report, it is simply suggestive of the necessity for better forms of government and control of universities, and without criticism I am bringing this to your attention for consideration in connection with your plan for university control. Let your plan include the state universities as well as those privately endowed. Good will come, I believe, from a frank discussion of the question.</p>

    <p>I am strongly in sympathy with your efforts to secure self-government in American universities. While the chief claim for the present hierarchy of officials—regents, president, deans, heads of departments—is that this form of organization makes for efficiency, in actual operation it leads to misdirection of effort, to non-representation or misrepresentation, to the elevation of personal interests above the good of all, and to unnecessary friction and strife, all of which spell waste and not efficiency. The specific ills in the state universities, at least, which appeal most to me are the following: (1) Lack of means of expression for all members of the staff of instruction. The men who have new ideas that are worth trying out are the young men who have no means of being heard. (2) The organization of the university by colleges instead of by faculties or by student groups. This leads to the erection of high walls around each college, the building up of vested rights in each faculty which becomes a close corporation for the defense of those rights. It leads to overlapping and duplication of work, to friction and waste of resources. Worse than these, it leads to disregard of the needs of the students and the public and contributes to crystallization along lines of personal interests, local tradition or ancient customs. This is one source of the provincialism of the state universities. (3) The control of departments by "responsible <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page233" title="233"></span>heads." This is largely responsible for the stifling of individual initiative, for much friction and neglect of proper university functions, for misdirection and waste of energies in furthering the personal views or interests of the head and for much if not most of the evils of playing politics. For example, I know one head of a department who has done practically no teaching or research for five years or more, none whatever in the last two years; who spends his time in playing politics for the purpose of making a large outward show for his department, securing buildings and apparatus in profusion, holding many offices and committee appointments, and leaving the internal affairs of his department in almost complete chaos. He never calls a conference of his staff, but takes care to consult them individually and alone if at all. His policies are not approved by a single member of his staff. Several, of them are called upon repeatedly to do the teaching for which he gives himself credit in the official announcements. There is no way under present conditions even to attempt the remedy of these things. (4) The mania for administration. The universities have gone administration-mad. Besides the deans of colleges who are not expected to do much teaching, a large number of men are spending more than half their time in administrative duties and most members of the faculties are asked to do so much committee work as to seriously interfere with their teaching and make research almost out of the question. Soon there will be so much administration that there will be nothing to administer. (5) The failure of most faculties to grasp the educational situation and work out any comprehensive policy fitted to the needs of the present students and the present-day community. The elective system, which was designed as a means of enabling the serious student to do a higher order of work, has degenerated into a means of enabling students to secure the bachelor's degree for four years of elementary work. As to the remedy for these evils, I can not agree with your proposed weakening of the presidency. In my own university it has been chiefly the weakness of the president which has allowed these evils to grow to such proportions as they have attained. I should rather say that the desirable thing is the strongest possible man as elected president in a democratic or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page234" title="234"></span>cooperative university society. I should like to see all but the most general powers taken away from the governing board (regents or trustees). Certain broad financial matters, the representation of the state university before the legislature and the fostering of favorable public sentiment, these functions may well reside in a board of regents. All else should be determined by some representative body of instructors. To such a body the president himself should owe his election in the first instance and possibly he should be subject to some form of "vote of want of confidence," or recall. For business and financial management there should be associated with the president a university comptroller with large powers. Educational policies should be in the hands of a university senate consisting of all men of the rank of professor. I would add to this senate a certain number of elected representatives of the younger men including instructors. These younger representatives might serve upon committees and take part in debate, and might or might not have votes. Among the plenums mentioned in your section (5) would be plenums of all instructors giving courses credited toward a given degree. These would serve all the proper purposes now served by colleges. For the more or less autocratic head of a department I would substitute a staff-conference which should elect its chairman for one or more years. This chairman would perform the duties of the present head of a department, except that he would be a representative of his staff. It might be desirable in laboratory subjects for the staff to elect a second representative in matters of building, equipment and supplies. The appointment of new members to the staff should be a subject of staff conference and election. Similarly the promotion of members to the rank of professor should be the result of election in which the staffs of closely allied departments should take part. Under such conditions the abuses of powers and of privileges by the heads of departments would scarcely be possible. Nevertheless, a further safeguard against the indolent politician should be provided in the form of a recommendation to reduce the rank of a member of staff or to dismiss him for continued neglect of duty or misconduct. Such a recommendation should be subject to approval by the senate. I can not share the confidence expressed by you in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page235" title="235"></span>the lifelong tenure of the professorship, after the abuses which I have seen. Some of these would be favored by this very security of position, and the greatest care in the selection of professors would not ensure against occasional unfortunate elections. "Eine verdorbene Apfel verdirbt viele andere." The evil effects of an occasional loafer in the high office of professor can scarcely be estimated. The possibility of recall by one's fellow workers would in no way or degree militate against good work or peace of mind on the part of a serious and honest man. It might prevent degeneration in the case of a weaker character. It is scarcely conceivable that the recall would be exercised except in cases of flagrant abuses. I think, after all, that my view does not differ essentially from yours. I agree that "the election should be for life, except in case of impeachment after trial."</p>

    <p>It is quite obvious that we are floundering in the management of universities, and you are crusading in a good cause when you attempt to bring about conditions under which scholarship, expressed in instruction and production or research, may have a fuller or more normal development. The problems to be solved are complex and no simple solution of all is possible. Some of your proposals, however, seem to me to point the way for some evolution in the right direction. Among these the following seem the most important: (1) The best traditions and most effective management would be conserved when the supreme control of the institution is invested in a corporation, which might be variously constituted according to the nature of the foundation. The trustees should perform the proper functions of such officers, of which the business management, care and increase of the endowment would be the most important. (2) The designation of an electorate for the presidency, or chief educational officer, is not easy to make. The faculty should have a dominant voice in naming a president, but it would be well to have electors representing the corporation at large, as well as the trustee element. This might serve to avoid factional divisions which might easily arise when one or two of the faculty were candidates for the presidency. The president should be selected without reference to his membership in the faculty, but should <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page236" title="236"></span>become a member by such election. Such security of tenure should be attached to the place as to attract men of ability, and the presidency should be referable to the electorate at all times, with proper protection of the personal interests of the incumbent. (3) The men representing interests so near together as to be readily grouped should form the unit of organization. These groups should be represented in a legislative body of the whole university. This smaller body or senate should serve as a council with the president on all matters pertaining to educational policy and also harmonize the activities of the groups or departments. The electorate for the faculty might well be constructed as you suggest—the interested group to have a dominant voice with other elements represented. It seems to me that the above ideas have been proved successful so far as they have been tried in various institutions, although of course not more than a few are practised in any form in one place.</p>

    <p>I agree entirely with your objections to the present system which puts so much power in the hands of one individual. I believe that a system of government such as you propose could be adopted now with advantage by universities in which the faculties are of a high type, and whose alumni take an active and intelligent interest. However, I do not think it could be adopted at present in institutions such as Missouri, Kansas and Minnesota, for the following reasons: (1) The alumni take little interest in university affairs—at least only a few of them do. Again they are apt to favor popular professors rather than men of a real university type. They do not recognize the value of the research man at all. (2) I doubt the ability of our faculties to govern themselves. This has practically been the state of affairs during the past eight or ten years of President Northrop's administration at Minnesota, and it has been a deplorable failure. The heads of the departments are in many instances men of inferior type. They would never remove one another to put in good men. The only salvation is a strong-armed executive, such as I believe we have in President Vincent. (3) Again, I do not believe that the state would delegate its powers to an organization of this kind. In Missouri and Kansas it is very difficult to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page237" title="237"></span>get adequate financial support from the legislatures. All support might be withdrawn if the enemies of the university could show that the professors had the power of fixing their own salaries. But, on the other hand, the scheme of control you have outlined is much more desirable than present conditions. I am in favor of working toward it even in the state universities. It may be practical in time in these also.</p>

    <p>In the main, I feel that the representative basis is the ideal toward which we must strive. It is trite to say that just how much of this is practicable at any given time and place is of course where opinions will vary. There are some qualifications of your ideas which I should favor, but in general I approve of your plan, as is shown by the following: (1) The corporation should consist of professors and other officers. The alumni should not be allowed a dominant influence, on account of their conservative tendency. A student (undergraduate) knows and sees about as much of university control as a passenger on a railway is able to learn of railroading. The corporation should elect trustees. Or, where trustees are elected by the people, I do not see how to separate the business administration from the educational, as such trustees have full control. In practise this is a democratic basis, but at present the top of this system is or may be autocratic. These trustees should delegate democratic powers to the faculty. (2) The president should be elected by a representative body, and probably for a limited term, but his term of years might be rather prolonged. I doubt the practicability of giving the president no more salary than a professor, particularly here where the tenure is so limited, and an able man knows the risks. At present some of our state universities need some of the elements of the "old" college president to manage the legislature. (3) Each unit of organization should be democratic, as the school or department. This should include financial autonomy. (4) Each school should elect its dean and executive committee, and they should be responsible to the bodies electing them. The nomination of professors might well be done as you suggest. I doubt if it is practicable to pay the same salaries to all professors, at least under present social conditions, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page238" title="238"></span>and especially in the case of lines with a practical bearing. The election of professors (full) is simpler in some respects than those of lower rank. And just as young men are jealous of possible competitors and slow to recognize or grant ability in rivals, on the other hand, heads or professors are similarly solicitous of younger rivals, and may be intolerant of divergent opinions and originality. With a change of conditions it might be possible to combine in our faculties both scholarship and executive ability. At present the preponderance of autocracy favors executive ability in all positions and often gives secondary consideration to scholarship.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that there are three classes of problems connected with this question, concerning finances, public representation, and educational administration. The third class should be subdivided, for the subject of educational administration may be either the student or the teacher. In American universities the financial responsibility rests either on the trustees alone or on the trustees and the president. Public representation is one of the duties of the president. The educational administration of the teaching force is also the president's business. The educational administration of the student body is largely left to the faculty, but is shared more or less by the president and the trustees. I understand that you are working toward an increased power of the faculty as compared with that of the president and the trustees. The present, relatively small, responsibility of the faculty, if defended at all, is usually defended on the ground of conditions peculiar to America. American universities had to be created out of nothing and had to serve the peculiar needs of a new nation. As our national life becomes more stable we may adopt a more democratic method of control, like that of the German universities. So it is argued. But I fear that those who argue thus misunderstand the administration of the German universities. I do not believe that imitating the German universities will do us any good. The same evils which we find here exist there, only worse. The faculty is supposed to control the instruction of the students and the appointment of the instructors. As a matter of fact, the faculty has no <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page239" title="239"></span>such powers. The American regards the doctor's degree as the normal end of a university course. That is the point where the misunderstanding enters. In Germany, not the doctor's degree (a mere decoration), but the state examination is the normal end of the university course. All the conditions for the state examination, as far back as the requirements for entrance to the university course, are fixed by the state department of education. The university faculty is completely left out, except in so far as some professors may also happen to hold positions in the state government. Compare the enormous influence of the faculty of an American university upon the course of instruction! The advantage is not on the German side. The German faculty is supposed to appoint, practically, the instructors. As a matter of fact, the only position filled by the faculty's own power is the unsalaried one of "Privatdozent," which does not even give the appointee a seat in the faculty, but only the permission to use a lecture room in the building. The misapprehension of the power of the faculty results chiefly from the fact that the faculty customarily makes recommendations as to the filling of a vacancy. But the man who actually fills the vacancy is the "Ministerialdirektor," just as in America it is the president; and the Ministerialdirektor may, and not infrequently does, throw the recommendation of the faculty into the waste-paper basket. You say that the power of the president places the American professor in a humiliating position. But the German professor is in an equally humiliating position. For positive proof, read the proceedings of the last meeting of German university professors in Hamburg, as published in the daily press a few months ago. No denunciations of any American university president by a humiliated professor can be worse than the similar denunciations publicly pronounced there on the late Ministerialdirektor Althoff, who for a generation ruled the Prussian universities with an iron hand. Most American writers do not seem to know the very existence of the office of the Ministerialdirektor, who is the German counterpart of the tyrant ruling over an American university. They fail to notice him because he does not rule over any one university, but over all the universities of the state; and because he never represents any university before the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page240" title="240"></span>public, this being the rector's duty. It is interesting that the very men who at that meeting complained of the despotic powers of the Ministerialdirektor had only praise for the general efficiency of university administration. We are accustomed to similar combinations of praise and blame in America. Don't let us look, then, to the German universities for remedies for our troubles; we do not easily find any there. Now let me turn to your propositions. I have no objection to the first. It places a part, but not a burdensome part, of the financial responsibility on the faculty. The faculty should have little of this responsibility; but at present the faculty has too little of it. Your second proposition as to the office of president I endorse with certain restrictions. I should endorse it without restriction if the representation of the university at public functions were not the president's but a different man's duty. If it is the president's duty, then he should receive a higher salary during his term of office (so does the German rector), quite aside from having his incidental expenses paid by the institution. However, I should regret to see a university represented at a public function by any man, whatsoever his prominence, other than one of its professors. In this point, I believe, the Germans should be our models. And then, too, it should be a different professor every year who, like the ever-changing German rector, represents the university before the public. Thus only can the public get the proper idea of what a university is, that is, the body of its professors. Therefore I conclude that the president should be elected annually from the professors by the professors, that during his term of office he should receive a fixed addition to his salary, and that there should be as much rotation in this office as possible. This rotation of office which I favor leads me to another point. The lack of knowledge among faculty members of the actual methods of administration and of the statutes by which it is governed in their own institution has become more striking to me from year to year. But its cause too has become clearer from year to year. It takes time to familiarize oneself with the administrative system. At present there is no inducement to give (or waste) this time except the advantage of being able to vote more intelligently at faculty meetings, where, however, a single vote <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page241" title="241"></span>does not count for much. Let the faculty member feel that once he will have to administer these statutes himself for a year before the public eye, and the inducement to know them is there. And after retiring from his term of office, what a different man he will be in faculty meetings. Thus only, it seems to me, can a faculty and the faculty meeting be made what it ought to be, instead of being, more or less justly, a target of jokes. I have hardly any criticism to make on your propositions concerning the organization of the schools, divisions or departments. I believe that the office of dean should rotate like the office of president, and I agree with you that in general there should be as much anarchy as is consistent with unity and order. I especially endorse that in the appointment of a professor some well-defined influence be given to experts in the subject outside the university.</p>

    <p>On the whole I can heartily endorse your proposal for university reorganization as something toward which we should be working. You are quite right in emphasizing the fact that no reorganization like this should be undertaken in a revolutionary fashion and any one can see how some of the provisions would have difficulties in particular institutions. Your plan seems an excellent starting point for an agitation looking toward fundamental changes, which is about all one can say of so revolutionary a program when first proposed. I like particularly your comments upon the provincialism of many boards of trustees and the absence of any personal understanding between trustees and faculty, also the benefit which institutions might derive by seeking more outside aid and criticism. Although I am now in an institution in which the defects of the present system are less in evidence than in most places, and although I have a real personal attachment to the president and great confidence in his integrity and ability, I am convinced that the system is wrong. There is, as I see it, a very fundamental difference in the scholastic and the administrative point of view, and a man who goes into the presidential office, even though he may have had some experience as a teacher and investigator, usually finds no time to continue this work and he gradually comes to a place where he has the administrative in place of the scholastic point of view. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page242" title="242"></span>I believe in administration by specialists, but I think every one should understand that the administration is not the main thing. The essential defect in the existing system lies in the magnification of the administrative function.</p>

    <p>Your plan for university control in its main outlines meets with my hearty approval. We live at present in an educational autocracy which is essentially undemocratic in principle and in spirit and disintegrating in its effect upon the independence and cooperation of our faculties. They have no ultimate control, and are all too prone to lose what little remains. In this university in the past ten years there have been a number of instances of the passage of important functions from the faculties into the hands of the executive. This situation is fundamentally subversive of the best interests of our democratic institutions; it tends to weaken initiative and subtly undermines effective constructive teaching and research. As to the details of your scheme permit me to criticize it—largely from the standpoint of the state university. (1) An extra-mural chancellor is a useless appendage, without adequate basis for "representing" the university to the community. Such a man should be chosen from the faculty and should combine educational experience, long knowledge of the state and community as well as the university, in order to interpret each to the other. (2) It would seem that the position of president as here defined is robbed alike of all honor and emolument and no one would care to assume its empty honors. I think you have gone too far in stripping the office of its dignity. This man should have more recognition and more power. As defined by you, he is below our deans in all respects. The university must have a leader, responsible to it, but he must have power for leadership and some financial recognition. (3) and (4) The departmental-division-school system is certainly the most effective for the unit itself. I have serious doubts as to the workability of complete educational autonomy of subdivisions. Even a small degree of this is leading in some of our universities to waste of effort, duplication of courses and equipment, and to rivalry resulting in lowered standards. (5) These recommendations are good as far as they go, but leave the "university as a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page243" title="243"></span>whole" too much the prey of factional interests. These interests are more sharply divided and unevenly balanced in state universities where economic pressure is affiliated with schools of agriculture, engineering, etc., than in endowed institutions not responsible directly to legislatures for their support. A loose system, containing "much of anarchy" would inevitably be disastrous to fields of learning where economic backing is feeble. Witness the recurring contests between state universities and agricultural and engineering colleges in states where the two are independent institutions, and the low standards of scholarship and research persisting in so many state universities in the agricultural departments, even under present autocratic control.</p>

    <p>On one point I believe there can be no doubt—as you suggest the university must be reorganized on a representative basis, so that the faculty may take some actual part in shaping the larger policies of the university, as well as minor matters, connected with the curriculum, which latter responsibility is about the only one they usually have at present. With regard to the first suggestion, I am inclined to think that for state universities at least the present plan of direct appointment of the regents by the governor is better than election by the people at large. I should like, however, to see some of the regents elected by the faculty and the alumni. I agree with the suggestion that the president should be elected by the faculty and be subject to recall by them, but I am somewhat in sympathy with the spirit of the times which inclines toward giving rather large powers to executive officers. A president should be more than a mere figurehead; but his activities should be rather in the direction of harmonizing and coordinating the departments from within, not in tyrannizing over them from without, often with no clear notion of their real needs. Certainly there should be no powers conferred on him by the trustees which could give him the impression that the members of the faculty are his hired men. It might be well to give him a somewhat larger salary than that of a professor, because the position probably entails larger expenses, but no great discrepancies ought to exist. With suggestions Nos. (3), (4) and (5) I fully agree. Appointments and dismissals (for cause only) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page244" title="244"></span>should be made by the faculty—no one man should exercise such a responsibility. Each department should have all the freedom consistent with the proportional welfare of all the departments. I am afraid that much of our present trouble arises from the prevailing indifference of faculty members to other departments than their own, and a failure to recognize their responsibilities to the university as a whole. How many times have I seen important business deferred because a quorum could not be obtained in faculty or committee meetings—and not always because the absent ones were engrossed in professional work, but sometimes because they found it hard to tear themselves away from the billiard table or golf links. Perhaps the suggestion that appeals to me most is that contained in footnote No. 9. But it is not merely or mainly legitimate administrative work that uses up the time and energy of our teachers. It is the absolutely useless and fruitless work of ascertaining whether students are or are not fit to receive their degrees. Of all medieval educational fetiches I think this is the worst—that students go to school and to college simply to be sorted and labeled. Let us confine our energies to trying to teach them—our labels are meaningless and will not stick—they will soon enough get labeled properly when their actual life work has fairly begun.</p>

    <p>Your proposed plan of university control is ideal; though in actual practise it would doubtless have to be greatly modified to meet varying conditions. In some respects the prevailing plan of university organization is probably advantageous during the present transition period of rapid growth and expansion. But as conditions become more stable, and as our institutions become real universities, in substance as well as in form, it seems to me that more democratic methods of administration become not only desirable but inevitable.</p>

    <p>The more I have considered it the more I am inclined to believe that some such plan could be adopted with advantageous results by our universities. The examples in Europe teach us that a powerful head is not essential for a university, and there are some obvious advantages in a purely democratic form of government. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page245" title="245"></span>I find nothing in your proposals to dissent from, and almost nothing with which I am not in complete agreement. Indeed, the only point that I feel any doubt about is the last sentence, and this is perhaps more a matter of terms than of anything else. I have seen such lack of correlation and coordination in universities, so much intellectual anarchy, that I am at a loss to know which is worst, a dead level of unity and order or a chaos of anarchy. Perhaps, after all, the worst situation is where one condition prevails in certain colleges, and the other in related colleges. At any rate, it seems perfectly clear that the universities can never be efficient self-regulating organisms unless they are democratic in the best sense of the word.</p>

    <p>I feel more and more confident that the administrative side of our American universities has a bad influence especially on the younger members of the instructional force. I do not feel that I have given your article entitled "University Control" sufficient thought to express an opinion on all the points involved, but I heartily agree with the method suggested for the election of professors. I also agree with you as regards the salary of the president. I believe that a very large part of the committee work in this institution, for instance, owes its existence to the interest in such work on the part of members of the instructional force, and to the foresight of shrewd deans interested in emphasizing their importance in the work of the university. As long as the largest salaries go to administrative officers, we can scarcely hope for better conditions. It is bad if the president receives more salary than the most noted professor, but when each of half a dozen deans is also paid more than any one who devotes his time and energy to teaching and the advancement of knowledge, things are doubly bad. I hope very much that such a scheme as you suggest will be given a trial in one of our largest institutions, by gradually adopting its various features. I should begin with the method of appointing professors.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that we must come to some other plan than the existing one, and a representative plan such as you outline must be the inevitable outcome if our faculties are to enjoy that free-
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page246" title="246"></span>dom and feel the accompanying responsibility that characterize our German colleagues in their organization. I think that your plan is admirable, and I have no specific suggestions that seem to me to be a real improvement. It seems to me that at our university we are slowly moving toward a democracy. However, the feeling still prevails quite strongly that the positions of dean, head professor, and president, of course, are more dignified, and these offices set the standard of the professor's value in the university activities. It has always seemed somewhat anomalous to me that the salary of dean should be so much higher than that of the professor when his work is largely administrative and clerical. I venture to say that the increase in vigor, virility and strength that would develop in a faculty during five years of life under a representative plan would really be a matter of surprise to skeptics.</p>

    <p>I am very favorably impressed with the scheme, which is certainly a much-needed one. Almost anything would be better than the absolute monarchies that by some strange freak of development have grown up in our republic in precisely the institutions that should stand for democracy. Naturally as an enthusiastic believer in democracy, and as a Californian of the most insurgent sort I should insist on the initiative, the referendum and the recall as an indispensable part of your scheme. Nothing else will ever continue to be satisfactory.</p>

    <p>I find myself clearest in regard to your section (2), the electing of the president by professors or officers; and the relation of his pay to theirs. With this I am in entire agreement. That phase of your program dealing with the choice of professors seems to me excellent—that the nomination for professorships should be approved by a board of advisers constituted as you say in section (4), especially the introduction of experts outside the university as a check upon mere personal considerations. The final election by the senate, and a veto-power vested in trustees, seem to me sound and proper features. The main thing is that the ultimate power shown should be in the hands of the "corporation" essentially as you plan it in the first sentence of section <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page247" title="247"></span>(1); but as to the details of organization of that body, and as to the inner organization of the faculty itself, I have no fixed convictions. It seems to me that (as you yourself would probably hold) these things will need experiment and will differ in different places, without affecting the heart of the matter. "What we need to express—and your plan would express it—is that administration is not the highest and most precious thing in the university; and the symbols of its elevation at present (external honors and high salary) express a perverted idea of its place in the university.</p>

    <p>(1) The board of trustees should function in the production and care of the university's income. The board should not dictate the spending of the income, certainly not in detail as between departments or needs of the university. (2) There should be a council or senate of professors, which should determine not only the educational matters, but the financial expenditures. The president should receive no greater salary than the highest rank of professor. He would not be able in such case to surround himself with a political coterie through his present power of appointment of professors or to use money for similar purpose by salary promotions. (3) I see no objection to this section. (4) Selection of professors and promotion in ranker salary should be made by the senate of professors [see (2)], not by the small division or department. A man who is a candidate for a professor's chair should look big or promising to a considerable number of experienced men. Moreover, a good man should not be subject to the jealousy of his associates in a small department. The charge of jealousy is, to be sure, too often a cheap way of making complaints, but, after all, jealousy itself is one of the commonest of human failings and manifests itself in most ugly ways. (5) The senate of professors should have real power and immediate control. I have no objection to a veto power by the trustees; it would be a wise check. But the professors should be able without useless conditions or handicaps to use the resources of the university. For example: all secretaries, clerks, stenographers, bookkeepers, curators and librarians should be at the service of the intellectual body in the university, to do what the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page248" title="248"></span>professors desire done for the advancement of the university and the cause of letters and science. As things are now in the University of California the "clerk gang" calls itself "administrative," runs the university, is incredibly ignorant and narrow and puts on most despotic and lofty airs. The salaries of clerks average much higher than the salaries of professors. This is ludicrous enough or would be if it were not so real. A number of professors have turned their positions into "administrative" offices. These professors without exception have no interest in their subjects and in a real reform would be properly labeled as clerks and made to work as such. No plan of whatever scope can, it seems to me, be successful which does not actually and genuinely provide for the encouragement of men who have a real interest in their subjects and are actually working and accomplishing things, that is, have real achievements in teaching or in research, or both, to their credit. At the same time, there should be discouragement, at least passive, of those men who do no work and more especially of those who sit around and do nothing but talk indefinitely, but volubly, of "research" and "scholarship."</p>

    <p>On one point in connection with this whole question I am quite clear: Until the universities of the country are put on a far more democratic basis as to organization, administration and general outlook than they are now on, they can not reach the high place in the nation's life they ought to hold; and much of what they do must continue to be positive disservice. It is inconceivable that a country committed to democracy in its entire governmental system could be very successful politically so long as the institutions of first importance to its intellectual life should be the very antithesis of democratic. The theory that the citizenry of the nation as a whole is capable of self-government, while the citizenry of the universities of the nation are not capable of self-government, is monstrous, and how we came to be trying to run things on this theory would be, I should think, a highly interesting subject of inquiry for a socialist. Whether the plan of control outlined by you would be best in all respects, I would not venture to say without more study than I have been able to give <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page249" title="249"></span>the problem in detail. Several of the suggestions strike me very favorably. On a few of them I am in considerable doubt. The methods of handling funds and making appointments would have to be determined with particular care and in the light of the widest experience. I am not sure from your letter that you would care for a general suggestion from me. Nevertheless I am going to venture one. It is that instead of breaking ground, so to say, on this hard practical question by trying to get the views of university men on so large a part of the whole of it at one time, it might be better to begin with the single question: Ought the universities to be made more democratic through and through? I may be wrong, but suspect there would be far from uniformity of reply. I believe there is a good deal of inadequate observation and rather hazy thinking on the subject. The state universities are furnishing some eye-opening object lessons in this direction. When one of these can travel over its state in an agricultural demonstration train to help the farmers on the spot with their sick chickens, their alkali lands, and their grasshopper troubles, at one extreme of its activities; and at the other live in isolation on a mountain top, occupied with the highest, most difficult of problems in "pure astronomy," and do it all on money raised by general taxation, there is surely some evidence against the view that a genuine democracy must of necessity be genuinely mediocre in all that appertains to the higher life. I notice by several remarks in your printed article that you fully realize the necessity of going slowly in this radical reformation. My suggestion is in that behalf. It seems to me that a thorough study first hand by some competent, unbiased person like yourself, of just what the state universities particularly (though by no means exclusively) are doing, would be a very good first step.</p>

    <p>I fully agree with your ideas concerning the reform of university control, but am inclined to believe that the cause of the present situation is not sufficiently appreciated. Nobody will deny that the shortcomings of the present system of university administration are, as you state, the product of two factors, the absolute power of the administrative body and its often high degree of incompetence. The former does more harm than the latter. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page250" title="250"></span>unwillingness of trustees and president to abandon their power is part of the general system of class rule. The trustees represent the ruling class of their state or community. They are more than anxious that their institution should not turn out men who might endanger their class privileges or prejudices. In regard to prejudices it is only necessary to mention the fact that until a few decades ago the trustees were trying to guard against the teaching of evolutionary doctrines. Since the theologians have convinced themselves that the teaching of evolution is not likely to disturb the order of things the dogmatic supervision of universities has somewhat relaxed. As far as class privileges are concerned, several facts may be mentioned. In state universities where the trustees owe their appointment directly or indirectly to the political machine, they naturally do not wish to see their institution turn out graduates who might become leaders against the forces to which the trustees owe their power and often their financial standing. In the big industrial centers the real class struggle is on and will not down. The millionaire trustees of the big universities can not be expected to encourage the development of leaders of democracy in this struggle. To accomplish their end they need absolute power for themselves and their executive, the president, and are bound to stand for it. As long as those who wish to reform the present system of university administration fail to realize that this system is part of modern class rule and that their efforts to change this system are part of the class struggle, the chances of their success remain doubtful.</p>
