    <h2 class="UC_heading2">III. The Corporation and The President</h2>

    <p><span class="first_word">In</span> a review of the different factors concerned with the administration of a university the corporation in ultimate control is the natural starting-point. It was becoming that the fellows of Yale College, a collegiate school primarily for the education of the clergy, should be representative clergymen of the state. In general the trustees of the primitive American college were competent to administer its simple economy. But even then there were difficulties. Before the American Institute of Instruction meeting in Worcester, Mass., in 1837, the Rev. Jasper Adams, president of Charleston College, gave a lecture on "The relations subsisting between the board of trustees and the faculty of the university," stating that as far as he knew this had never been the subject of special investigation. He argues that the trustees should manage the funds of their institution, while the faculty should regulate the courses of instruction and the internal administration. Professors should be appointed by the trustees on the advice of and in accordance with the wishes of the faculty. It appears that in those days there was trouble through the trustees interfering with what the faculties regarded as their rights, notably at Hamilton College, concerning which the president wrote a pamphlet entitled "A Narrative of the Embarrassments and Decline of Hamilton College," which he attributed to meddling by the trustees with the business of the faculty. At that time President Adams and President Davis seem to have regarded themselves as professors rather than as trustees. According to President Adams:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page27" title="27"></span>More than one board of trustees has ruined, and every board will ruin its college, which shall interfere with the province rendered appropriate to the faculty by the peculiar skill, knowledge and experience which their education, greater attention to the subject, and practical opportunities, have naturally, and as a matter of course, given them. . . . Many a faculty of a college, who felt themselves qualified, not only to sustain their institution, but to raise it to usefulness and renown, and gain for it the favor, confidence and patronage of the public, have found all their efforts discouraged, embarrassed and finally defeated by the conduct of their board of trustees. Plans of improvement, after having been matured by much labor and careful consideration, have been presented for acceptance and approbation, only to be retained with coldness and indifference, treated with neglect and finally rejected, after a hasty examination, for want of a competency to understand them. Favorable times and seasons have been permitted to pass by unimproved, and have been lost never to return, because the faculty had not power to act on the subject, and the trustees could not be induced to seize the favorable moment, and turn the occasion to the benefit of the institution. Under these circumstances, the faculty have been compelled to remain inactive, and let things take their course, or to resign their office in discouragement and disgust. In either case, the institution has been ruined.</blockquote>

    <p>The legal powers of trustees and regents are similar everywhere, but their actual part in the conduct of the institution varies greatly. It is likely to be larger when the board is small and when the members reside near by. In his Harris lectures on "University Administration" President Eliot says: "The best number of members for a university's principal board is seven," and with pleasing naivete he adds a little later: "It is a curious fact that the university with the most fortunate organization in the country is the oldest university, the principal governing board, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, consisting of seven men." When the board of trustees is large and meets but rarely, there is usually an executive committee which with the president is in substantial control. The members of this committee are likely to be the friends and adherents of the president—<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page28" title="28"></span>in practise the president is likely to select the trustees and the members of their executive committee—and the faculties and professors are supposed to communicate with the trustees only through the president. Under our existing system, there should be an elected committee of the faculties which would meet with the executive committee of the trustees. It would in addition be advisable to permit the professors and other officers to elect for limited terms representatives—not necessarily from among themselves—on the board of trustees in the manner now becoming usual for alumni representation. It is undesirable for the individual professor to tease the trustees with his needs or grievances; but there should surely be some way by which trustees and professors can consider together the problems confronting the university. A joint committee of trustees and professors such as has just now been constituted to administer the Crocker Cancer Research Fund of Columbia University is an excellent plan.</p>

    <p>If trustees are trustees and not directors, it does not greatly matter in practise how many of them there are or how they are chosen, so long as they are men of integrity and honor, representative of the common sense of the community. Even if the trusteeship is an acknowledgment of gifts made or hoped for, no great harm is done. But a self-perpetuating board with absolute powers, even though for a generation the powers may not be abused or even used, is intolerable in a democratic community. The president and directors of industrial corporations are elected by the shareholders and are increasingly supervised by the state. In the state universities the regents are elected by the people or appointed by their representatives, and the people may be regarded as the ultimate corporation. In the case of the private universities, it would apparently be wise to have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page29" title="29"></span>a large corporation consisting of the professors and other officers of the university, the alumni who maintain their interest in the institution and members of the community who ally themselves with it. This corporation—or perhaps better the three groups of which it is composed—should elect the trustees. Thus there might be a board of nine trustees, one being elected annually for a three-year period by each of the three divisions of the corporation.</p>

    <p>Several of my correspondents hold that the members of the community permitted to join the corporation of a university should be carefully selected. I should myself like to see the widest possible participation. If 10,000 or 50,000 people would join such a corporation, so much the better. They would pay dues, perhaps five or ten dollars a year, and would enjoy certain privileges such as attendance at lectures and concerts, the use of libraries, museums, rooms for meetings and the like. If many people are concerned with their university, it is well for them and for it. Some of them will become seriously interested, ready to aid with their counsel, their influence and their money. In New York City several institutions—the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History, the Zoological Park, the Botanical Garden—are partly supported by the city, partly by boards of trustees and partly by members. The buildings are owned and the curators are paid by the city; the collections are owned and the research work is paid for by the trustees; the members have certain privileges in return for dues. In spite of obvious difficulties, the plan has worked well.</p>

    <p>A large corporation holding the university in trust for all the people is clearly a step in the direction of public ownership. It is the ultimate fate of every corporation to be controlled by the state, and our private <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page30" title="30"></span>universities will surely become part of the system of public education. This should develop gradually rather than through such measures as have been required to obtain control of church property in other nations. When the people own their universities they will probably see the wisdom of delegating to those concerned—namely, the officers of the university, its alumni and members of the community taking an interest in higher education and having knowledge of it—the right to elect the trustees. True democracy does not consist of government by the uninformed, but of government by those most competent, selected by and responsible to the people. In one of the leading state universities one third of the trustees are elected by the alumni; a second third might to advantage be elected by the teachers, the remaining third being elected by the people or their representatives.</p>

    <p>When trustees in the state universities are elected by the people or their representatives and in the private universities are elected by the corporation consisting of officers of the university, alumni and members of the community, the question as to their powers and duties is perplexing. Much can be said in favor of giving them no more power than is vested in a trust company designated as trustee of an estate, and arguments can be urged in favor of a small paid board of experts having the ultimate decision on all questions. I seem to have been almost the only educational person in the country who approved of the principle of Mayor Gaynor's plan for a small paid board of education for New York City, and I should regard its present adoption as risky. This, however, is the correct method of democracy—experts selected by the people and paid for their work. The professors and other officers of the university should be such. Whether in addition to them it is desirable or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page31" title="31"></span>necessary to have a board to coordinate and control their work, to regulate their duties and fix their salaries, is a question which can only be settled by experience. Certainly the commission form of government is preferable to an individual autocrat.</p>

    <p>In the academic jungle the president is my black beast. I may seem to be in the condition of the animal suffering from the complication of diseases described in a recent issue of a New England paper:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation">Patrolman Lindstrum went to East Elm Street recently and shot an alleged mad dog. The dog also was declared to have hydrophobia and rabies.</blockquote>

    <p class="no_indent">As a matter of fact neither barking nor biting is warranted. An eminent philosopher of Harvard University in a lecture to a class at Radcliffe is alleged to have depicted in eloquent terms the darkness of the life of him who has lost his religious faith and then to have added that the only compensation is a sense of humor. Whereat, first one and then another of the students began to weep until all the eighty girls were in tears. It is more becoming for university professors to appreciate the semi-humorous absurdity of the situation than to fall to weeping together. I once incited one of my children to call her doll Mr. President, on the esoteric ground that he would lie in any position in which he was placed. Of course, the president is by nature as truthful, honorable and kind as the rest of us, and is likely to have more ability or enterprise, or both. But he really finds himself in an impossible situation. His despotism is only tempered by resignation; and in the meanwhile he must act as though he were a statue of himself erected by public subscription. In Tennyson's words:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation">Who should be king save him who makes us free.</blockquote>

    <p>The argument for giving a free hand to the president is that this is the way to get things done. It should, however<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page32" title="32"></span>, be remembered that it is quite as important—and this holds especially in the university—not to do the wrong thing as it is to do the right thing. The time of the president is largely occupied with trying to correct or to explain the mistakes he has made, and the time of the professor is too much taken up with trying to dissuade the president from doing unwise things or in making the best of them after they have been done. Administrative details should be attended to promptly and correctly; this is the proper business of secretaries and clerks. Then we need leaders, most of all in a democracy. But in a democracy leaders are the men we follow, not the men who drive us. In the university each should lead in accordance with his ability and his character.</p>

    <p>The trouble in the case of the university president is that he is not a leader, but a boss. He is selected by and is responsible to a body practically outside the university, which in the private corporations is responsible to nobody. In our political organization, the mayor, governor or president has great power, too great in my opinion, if only because it demoralizes the legislature; but they are responsible to the people who elect them. I object even more to the irresponsibility of the university president than to his excessive powers. The demoralization that the president works in the university is not limited to his own office; it has given us the department-store system, the existing exhibit of sub-bosses—deans, heads of departments, presidential committees, professors appointed by, with salaries determined by, and on occasion dismissed by, the president, all subject to him and dependent on his favor.</p>

    <p>It is not my wish to depreciate unfairly the services of the American university president. Like the promoter in business and the boss in politics, he has doubtless been <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page33" title="33"></span>a factor natural and perhaps desirable in a given stage of evolution, when the growth of the complexity of society and the need of new adjustments have outrun the adaptability of the individual. It is probable that the president has increased appropriations and gifts; it is possible that he has promoted rather than hindered the development of the university and the extension of its work. The president, however, has not usually been the cause of gifts, professors and students, but only the means of diverting them from one institution to another, and on occasion of doing so in ways unworthy of the institution which he then misrepresents. The president has not infrequently sacrificed education to the fancied advantage of his own institution. Thus college entrance requirements have imposed studies on the high school which drive from it the majority of boys. The opposition of certain presidents of proprietary universities to a national university is not less pernicious if it results from honest prejudice. The prestige of the president is due to the growth of the university, not conversely. He is like the icon carried with the Russian army and credited with its victories. President Eliot claimed that he had never asked for a gift for Harvard. During the lean years he was regarded as a poor money-getter; when the fat years came with the increasing wealth of the alumni and of the country, this opinion was reversed, but he had not changed. President Eliot is a truly great man, but his remarks on all sorts of subjects, usually wise but occasionally otherwise, were reported everywhere, not for their wisdom, but on account of his position.</p>

    <p>While I regard it as desirable to do what little I can to make ridiculous an institution which has become a nuisance, and while I should find my state of dependence on a president for my opportunity to serve the university intolerable if I concealed my views, I certainly do not <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page34" title="34"></span>wish to be understood as lacking in appreciation of the fine characters and high motives of most of the men who have served as professors and later become presidents. They do not considerably, if at all, surpass in character or ability the average standard of the professorship, but they exploit before the world how high this standard is. The practise of many presidents is a sacrifice of their real convictions to the imagined exigencies of the situation. Most of them would agree that autocracy in the university is undesirable. Thus President Eliot writes:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation">The president of a university should never exercise an autocratic or one-man power. He should be often an inventing and animating force, and often a leader; but not a ruler or autocrat. His success will be due more to powers of exposition and persuasion combined with persistent industry, than to any force of will or habit of command. Indeed, one-man power is always objectionable in a university, whether lodged in president, secretary of the trustees, dean or head of department.</blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Seelye, then president of Smith College, at the inauguration of Dr. Rhees as president of Rochester University, said:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation">Autocracy, however, is a hazardous expedient, and is likely to prove ultimately as pernicious in a college as it is in a state. It induces too great reliance upon the distinctive characteristics of a despot, and too little upon those of a gentleman. One-man power is apt to enfeeble or to alienate those who are subject to it. . . . Successful autocrats are few, and however long their term of service, it is short compared with the life of an institution. If they leave as an inheritance a spirit which has suppressed free inquiry, and which has made it difficult to secure and retain teachers of strong personality, the loss will probably be greater than any apparent gain which may have come through the rapid achievements of a Napoleonic policy.</blockquote>

    <p>Under existing conditions—at least in our proprietary universities—it appears that the place which the president now fills, or wobbles about in, might be divided into three parts. There might be a chancellor, as in the English universities, a man of influence and of prominence, representing the corporation and the relations of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page35" title="35"></span>the institution to the community, concerned with increasing the endowment and prestige of the university. Then there might be a rector, as in the German universities, elected annually or for some other limited period by and from the faculties, presiding at academic functions and the like. In the third place, there would be a secretary or curator, an educational expert in charge of administrative details. In a real democracy and with a people appreciative of the needs and service of the university, the former two officials would become superfluous.</p>

    <p>It must be admitted that the situation is difficult. The alumni are no longer predominantly scholars or even professional men. They have more concern for football than for the work of the professor; any university club could get on better without its library than without its bar. But the alumni of a university should be not less intelligent and wise than the electorate of the nation. In both cases the ultimate control must be democratic, unless perchance we are following false gods. Experts and intellectuals are not, as a rule, to be trusted to act for the common good in preference to their personal interests. The professors of an endowed university can not be given the ultimate control. A monastery or a proprietary medical school must ultimately be reformed from without. We need the referendum and the recall because we can not trust those placed in authority, and we fear these measures because we do not trust the people. An aristocracy is deaf; a democracy is blind. But it is our business to do the best we can under the existing conditions of human nature. Advancing democracy has burned its bridges behind it. No one believes that a city should be owned by a small self-perpetuating board of trustees who would appoint a dictator to run it, to decide what people could live there, what work they must do and what incomes they should have. Why should a university be conducted in that way?</p>
