    <h2 class="calibre9">X. Letters from Institutions in the Middle States</h2>

    <p>University education is and of right should be essentially aristocratic. It is the higher intellectual activity on which a true aristocracy—an aristocracy of intellect—must be based and as historical fact has been based in every civilized country of the world except this (if by courtesy this may be called a civilized country). Efficiency in government has been well proved by experience to come through the individual. The boss, the mayor, the president, the university head, are expressions of the necessity for concentration of responsibility and control in one man. Schemes of direct nominations or commission government and of faculty control are the antagonistic conceptions. The former are in accordance not so much with the American genius as with the Anglo-Saxon practise. The latter all make for division of responsibility among a people that wants to hold some one man responsible—to blame oftener than to praise, but at least to throw the burden of blame or praise on one pair of shoulders. The person outside the university looks on the job of the university president as one which ought to, if it does not, require the free use of the locust, for he sees a man surrounded by a great army of specialists each one of whom would be false to his trust if he did not regard his own as of paramount importance in the university scheme and make all conceivable demands on its behalf; and yet the president must be the miscreant who by virtue of his eminent office must hammer down these aspirations so that they may all fit into the definite policy which it may be plausibly supposed every such great institution pursues. Like Satan, a university president is by merit raised to his bad eminence, for his activities, if for the good of the university body, must often seem harsh and heartless to the individual professor. As uneasy rests the head that wears a crown, as the policeman's life is not a happy one, so in this matter of fitting the wheels of a great university machine so that they will move <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page166" title="166"></span>with minimum friction the university president's career is not to be judged by the smoothness of his countenance. A board of trustees, to a university president, is and must of its essence be a body to ensure confidence in the administration of large finances, but a body to be ignored in the execution of a scholastic policy. The latter control might wisely be placed in a cabinet of advisers chosen by the president himself from his faculties. The efficiency of our constitutional government in giving the president of the United States this power has proved itself. No one would change it and it would seem a practicable and efficient scheme for university control. It would not diminish the all-important factor of one-man power and one-man responsibility. We encourage a conviction in this country that the people know what is best for them, but in practice we cast this theory aside and give the people what we believe they need. I suspect that the university community may be in the same situation. In spite of grandiose mottoes, the American university does not yet exist where any one can learn anything on any subject. Entire freedom of expression of the best results of careful thinking and research is still restrained as a concession to the great body of conventional thinkers (including most university presidents) which make up our lagging communities. The government of a university, however, should not be hurried along by experiment with revolutionary schemes. Paper devices for the immediate reform of the language, for the abolition of war or for the overturn or unwholesome acceleration of any of nature's evolutionary processes, whether or not backed by the wealth of-the untutored Crœus, will be of uncertain value, and it would be the part of wisdom to square any suggestion of change in the policy of an American university with the slow changes in the progress of our community life.</p>

    <p>The small college in which I teach is governed by a benevolent autocrat, to whose wise and kindly rule our prosperity is largely due. I recognize, however, that a large university has very different administrative problems from a small college, and that the various departments should have a good deal of—perhaps complete—independence in the management of their affairs. I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page167" title="167"></span>should think, however, that the head professor of a department should not be chosen by the department, but by the president or trustees. If a department should choose its head, there is the greatest danger that other considerations than the good of the department would influence—perhaps unconsciously—the choice. Thus if the department happens to be made up of mediocre men they would be apt to choose a man of their own stamp for their head, rather than a man of first-class ability. Then, too, if the department's head owed his election to his immediate colleagues, he would be apt to feel towards them quite differently from if he had obtained his place from the president or the trustees. I am not sure that the head professor ought not to have autocratic power within his department. This is the arrangement in German and Austrian universities so far as I know them. Of course a wise administrator would consult the wishes and welfare of his associates and would run his department without friction, but at the same time he would fix the policy of the department and be responsible for its success. If the government of a department is democratic there are sure to be wire-pulling and politics, jealousies and discontent—unless indeed the men composing the department are unusually harmonious.</p>

    <p>I am coming more and more to the conclusion that no purely mechanical form of organization will overcome the influence of individual initiative and individual inertia; I mean by this that you can not circumscribe the influence of a very aggressive man, and you can not force groups of individuals to uniform activity in parallel grooves. For this reason, I am afraid that any more elaborate plan of coordination is likely to break down of its own weight. It is not merely due to my early training that I consider the Harvard plan of university control superior to those of which I have knowledge<!--original spelling was "knowldge"-->, or even the system proposed by yourself. We have only two bodies: one compact, and, undoubtedly, effective for proper business administration; the other representative of the loyal alumni body, and, through the visiting committees, reaching out still more effectively in the direction indicated by your footnote 2. Slight modifications of the franchise might be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page168" title="168"></span>adopted, such as giving the professors votes, even though they be not alumni, giving a vote for each earned degree, and, possibly, providing for a certain number of faculty representatives in the board of governors. The bi-cameral system of control has worked remarkably well at Harvard and has certainly provided for very open discussion of every proposed change of policy. I totally disagree with paragraph (2); for I believe that the president should be largely an executive officer. I fully agree with paragraphs (3), (4), (5) and (6), and think that the deans should have a larger degree of autonomy than heretofore, being, in fact, the educational heads of their respective faculties, but not, by any means, as in the flagrant case of Columbia, the personal lieutenants of the president.</p>

    <p>I believe that there is much in the plan which is desirable. I should favor some plan which would give more authority to the faculties of our universities and less to the presidents and trustees. However, I should consider it a too radical change to give the power of appointment and removal of members of the faculty entirely into the hands of the faculty. I fear that some faculties would be split into contending factions, if they tried to elect a committee which should appoint new members, and, whether this is true or not, I am sure that if the power of removal were left to the faculties it would mean either that no members would ever be removed or that there would be dissensions which would hurt the usefulness of the universities. No doubt some will say that members of a university council should never, at most very rarely, be removed. With this I can hardly agree. Personally I should be pleased to know that no matter how indolent I might become, or how vicious doctrines I might teach, I should still be sure of my salary, but it would not conduce to the welfare of a university to have either myself or others have this assurance. When a student in college I formed the idea that some universities would be improved if some professors could be led to identify their interests with some other profession than that of teaching. Things that I have seen and heard since then have convinced me that such an idea was quite correct. I believe that such changes would be more apt to be done and done prop-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page169" title="169"></span>erly by a somewhat autocratic president than by a faculty. The fact that plans similar to the one suggested have worked well in other countries is well worth considering, but it is far from a proof that they would be an improvement, if adopted in our own land. This is true first because the conditions here are in many ways different from those abroad and, second, because there is no way of being sure that they are the best even for foreign countries.</p>

    <p>Taken as a whole I think this scheme of university control is good, but I am not quite up to the point of viewing the chancellor of a university as a person having no special abilities in outlining educational policy. I am used to thinking that the head of a university ought to have a very definite knowledge of its educational work and be capable of guiding and correlating this. Instead of the proposition advanced in (2) I should be rather inclined to favor creating the position of dean of the whole faculty whose position would be as much more important than that of the every-day professor as the dean of a single school is at least, and such a man if chosen by the faculty ought in any event to be <i>persona grata</i> to the chancellor and in a way his educational adviser or agent in correlating the work of the university. I have not been impressed with the experience of at least two southern universities which have tried out the system of a president or chairman of the faculty, whose position was regarded as no more dignified than that of a professor. Again, I am not sure that conditions, as I understand them in most universities, would make it an advisable plan to have a committee of the whole university act as a coordinate body with the executive committee of the trustees. It seems to me that in spite of a great need to have the office of the faculty made powerful in the management of the university, in the end a body like the trustees, acting through their executive, the chancellor, must have final authority. On any other basis, I am afraid that the efforts at university management would result in a degree of anarchy greater than the optimum which your plan considers to be favorable. I am afraid that my foregoing remarks will scarcely support the opinion which I have harbored that there <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page170" title="170"></span>should be the largest possible degree of democracy in the management of a university, and that specialists in the different branches of learning should have authority in proportion to their knowledge<!--original spelling was "knowldge"--> in shaping educational policy.</p>

    <p>With provision (1) I am in complete agreement. In provision (2) it is stipulated that the "salary [of the president] should not be larger." Since, however, the expense of maintaining the presidential position properly is necessarily considerable, and since the administrative duties are in the nature of business affairs, I believe that a salary of from one to two thousand more a year should be paid to the president. The provision (3) is of course not one about which any legislation can be made, although it represents the ideal toward which we must work. The plan proposed in (4) is of very serious moment. Owing to the fact that our largest universities are still increasing their endowment rapidly, it is probably unnecessary to give each division financial autonomy and to encourage it to increase its trust fund. On the matter of nomination by the department of the professors, I dissent strongly from the plan. Such a plan would bring about a fixed rate of promotion based entirely upon considerations of seniority, at least if the good will within the department is to be maintained. I believe that the nominations for professorships should be made by the professors in the departments. With the remainder of this provision I agree.</p>

    <p>(1) The board of trustees should not be self-perpetuating; new members should be elected by a meeting of the trustees, faculty, and one representative from each class which has graduated. In this manner the whole university is represented by the trustees. I do not see much need for the corporation; it is a multiplication of bodies without much corresponding benefit to the university. (2) The trustees should do all the "begging" or "hustling" for money; they tend to delegate this to the president, but this is a prostitution of the duties and responsibilities of the presidency, and a delinquency on the part of the trustees. (3) The trustees and faculty together should elect a president, one who "has expert knowledge of education and of uni-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page171" title="171"></span>versity administration," and who spends his time in using those abilities. When a president is drawn away from this to do the work of-the trustees in providing funds, the real work of the university is left without an administrative head, and scholastic chaos is apt to result, each department going its own sweet way, and all useful coordination and cooperation thrown to the winds, leaving the institution like a ship without a helmsman. (4) I agree entirely with suggestion of paragraph (3). (5) The election of professors, nominated by the unit group or school in consultation with the president and able outsiders, should be left to the joint meeting of trustees and faculty. (6) For your senate, I would substitute joint meetings of trustees and faculty, meaning by the latter the deans and executive committees of all departments. (7) Misunderstandings between faculty and trustees are frequent. If the trustees and faculty would but meet together once in a while and exchange opinions and views they would be able to work together in harmony and jointly would constitute the most effective university senate possible, for such business as electing a president or professors down to minor details of university welfare.</p>

    <p>In the main I agree with your plan for university control. I am in hearty sympathy with all but one of its chief features. I have watched rather carefully the system of government at Princeton for over twenty years. The features in your plan which I approve are as follows: (1) The election of trustees for definite terms by a corporation consisting of alumni, professors and other officers. (2) The division of the executive office between a chancellor and a president, in much the way you outline. We have virtually been trying such an experiment for the past year at Princeton. The election of the president, or chief administrative officer, by the faculty, would ensure his proper responsibility to that body. (3) Autonomy of each department, school or similar unit in matters which do not concern other departments. (4) Recommendations for professorships by a board of advisers constituted as you suggest, with stable tenure of office for all full professors, and equal salary for equal duties. (5) A faculty senate to settle routine matters <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page172" title="172"></span>and questions of lesser importance affecting more than one department; and a plenum to settle graver issues. My one great objection to your scheme is its reduction of the president to a mere figurehead. We have a tradition of autocratic government at Princeton extending through at least three presidencies, and many of us who have been staunch supporters of the administration share your ideal of a university democracy. But even a president elected by his colleagues and responsible to them must be clothed with authority to settle disagreements between departments in matters of academic policy, promotion and distribution of common funds; and a certain "dignity of office" is essential to the graceful acceptance of his decisions by all concerned. Furthermore, the intricate duties and manifold responsibilities attaching even to a limited presidency demand special compensation. To comment on a few minor details: (1) Except in state universities I should not favor including in the corporation "members of the community who ally themselves with it." It might degenerate into something like the colonization of doubtful districts in politics. (2) Your statement regarding electing a president by "the professors or officers, or their representatives" is not quite clear. (3) I should not favor limiting the department or unit to twenty members, although that is probably a convenient maximum in most cases. (4) Such matters as the number of courses offered by each department and the size of its teaching force concern the whole university under Princeton's theory of a well-articulated curriculum; for this reason I believe the plenum or general faculty meeting should play a much larger role in academic government than you indicate.</p>

    <p>In your plan of university control, I think that paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) are very good, particularly the arrangement for a dual headship. The arrangement in (4) for appointing professors and instructors, however, seems to me hardly superior to the "department-store method." Where similar schemes have been tried, my impression is that they have worked for uniformity of promotion irrespective of excellence. The ideal scheme should aim at the most rapid possible promotion to the highest posts of the best men. We may safely trust the interests <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page173" title="173"></span>of the average man to the well-known tendency of all institutions. The most satisfactory method of appointments of professors which I know of is that in vogue at Cambridge University, where each chair has not only a professor but also a standing committee to elect his successor. I should think that some practicable modification of this could be worked out.</p>

    <p>The plan of university control which you have submitted seems in my opinion an exceedingly good one. The suggestion in sections (1) and (2) that there should be a chancellor and a president with entirely different functions, is an innovation that would greatly strengthen the American university. The president could then be a man selected primarily for scholastic attainment, whose interests were centered in the advancement not only of teaching, but also of learning.</p>

    <p>Concerning your proposed scheme of university control let me say that the various articles together with the explanatory footnotes meet my views very well. I would prefer a few changes, but these, for the most part, would be minor. If the president is elected from the faculty and possesses the required abilities for such an office in addition to his abilities as a professor I should not object to having him receive more salary while holding the office. I do not think, however, that it should be two or three times as much as the professors get, as is the case now. Neither should I object to the position being considered rather more dignified than that of the professor. I am not sure about some of the other points such as the separate endowments for the divisions, but as said before these are minor matters perhaps.</p>

    <p>I was at one time a member of a faculty which was of itself all-powerful, and yet was absolutely non-progressive. It seems to me that, in general, the more or less complete independence of the individual departments makes for efficiency. I have often thought that the German system of having a central business management with an annually elected Rector magnificus of the professorial body to represent the university at state functions, was a plan which might well be adopted in this country. Noth-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page174" title="174"></span>ing can be worse for a university than the development of its president into an autocrat, when such autocracy is accompanied by a feeling of materialism which comes through pride in material accomplishments and association by preference with people who can afford the means for the development of material accomplishments.</p>

    <p>Your outline of university control I believe to be desirable in the main. What we need is a scheme of organization which will preserve the best in our system of executive administration and eliminate the worst. I would not abolish the presidency, but would greatly curtail its powers in matters of appointment and appropriations. Most presidents, I fancy, would welcome this change.</p>

    <p>In a general way I approve of the proposal as a whole, but feel that many matters of detail should be worked out.</p>

    <p>In a general way the suggestions meet my views and you are at liberty to quote me as being generally in favor of it.</p>

    <p>In your article on university control, I quite approve of what is said. I really see no reason for making any anti-critique or special commentary.</p>

    <p>I have always been very strongly in sympathy with such anti-autocratic sentiments as you have expressed in that article and elsewhere. From my own experience in one institution, I am led to believe that the head of a department is capable of being quite as autocratic, within his own sphere, as is the president himself. Indeed, the evils attendant on such a situation had much to do with my giving up teaching some years ago. But your scheme covers intra-departmental organization, as well as the organization of the university as a whole. I should like to hope that it would be put into effect within a finite period of time. But is not the trend of great organizations to be autocratic, or at least anti-individualistic, as witness the "trusts," and the government departments here in Washington.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page175" title="175"></span>The plan of university control which you sent to me meets my approval so far as it goes, because it embodies the great features of the control of the English universities and those of at least one of our own great universities, and does not contain any feature which may not be adopted by any university in our country without introducing disturbing factors. I think that so far as our corporations can bring themselves to arrange the responsibilities which now devolve upon them so as to allow the operation of the plan which you propose to come into operation, so far they will advance the cause of higher education and research.</p>

    <p>Your scheme for "University Control" appeals to me very much. It is quite a difficult question and since most institutions, as you say, have gone through a developmental period while others are under state control or denominational control, only a gradual change can be expected. It takes a broad-minded man to be a trustee. Many alumni prove wonderfully successful, while I have, alas, seen cases where much mischief was wrought by whole-hearted alumni who were unequal to the duties reposed in them. Recently a banquet was given to Professor H. E. Armstrong in London. In his speech he said the following:
<blockquote>"Teachers are now threatened with interference in all sorts of ways. The success of our college, I am sure, is due to the fact that we were trusted with its entire management on the educational side. The institute has exercised financial control, and all our proceedings have been regularly reported to it—but we have been left alone to do the work. My good friend Mr. Blair told us last September, in a most valuable paper 'On the Relation of Science to Industry and Commerce,' which he gave to the British Association, that the management of all technical institutions and departments of applied science should be put on a business footing. The chief need, he said, was that of a consultative committee composed of industrial or commercial leaders or experts of the highest reputation. I would suggest to Mr. Blair that he undertake an inquiry similar to that which he made into technical education into the ways of business men and manufacturers; as a result, he will find it desirable, I think, to propose <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page176" title="176"></span>the formation of consultative committees of teachers to advise the business men. When the two kinds of committees come together if they are composed of sensible men, probably there will be agreement that it is best for each party to look after its own business."</blockquote></p>

    <p>It is a general opinion that a professorial position is secure against the vicissitudes of business, that while the salaries may be low there is a guarantee of permanence which compensates for the lesser revenue. From a wide experience both in institutions with which I have been connected in the past and from watching this question as found in other schools I deem this view unsound. I have known of professors deprived of their professorships practically overnight by some sudden changes in the policy of an institution, and I have known indeed whole faculties at odds with governing bodies. Under such circumstances we can not expect men of exceptional talent to enter university or college life unless a revision is made in existing methods of governing and conducting our educational institutions.</p>

    <p>Although my experience in universities in the official capacity of professor is very limited, I am, because of this experience, in sympathy with the critics of the present method of the conduct of the universities. Some of the diagnoses appear to me to be correct, but as far as I am aware the therapeutics have been faulty. There is not one disease, but many, in the universities, and there is not one remedy that can be applied for the amelioration of the conditions, but many drastic drugs must be used. There can be no doubt that the control of the university should not be in the form of a complete democracy; it must be more of an oligarchy, the individuals making up this controlling party being those best fitted by education, interests, etc., to have in mind the interests of and to legislate for the university as a whole. Since, however, there are many special interests to be kept in mind by a university, it would appear wise to have these various interests represented in the corporation and in the scheme of conduct of the university as a whole. The professor is not all-wise, even in his own special field, and it is my belief that if professors made up a large proportion of the trustees, there would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page177" title="177"></span>result more anarchy than exists at present. University politics would replace university policies, and without a guiding hand, however unskillful, wreck would surely ensue. The interests of the university are too varied to be divided absolutely into separate fields, but the educational and the financial may be taken to be those with which the community are chiefly concerned. I believe these two parts of the administration of a university may be separated with success and to the great advantage of the community and the teaching body in the university. The corporation should be made up of the members of the community, the city or state or country, or those who from previous connection have the welfare of the institution at heart. In other words, those individuals who contribute to the welfare of the institution should be the corporation. The professor should be a part of this corporation, not as a professor but as any other individual. Trustees should be elected by this corporation. These trustees should represent the bodily or material university to the public, they should have care of the financial interests, the care of the property, etc. In addition to this body (which should have the main function of determining how much money should be expended, whether or not the university finances warrant the building of new buildings, the remodeling of old, etc.) there should be a legislative body whose main concern is that of education and the representation of the educational work of the university to the community. It is obvious that this second body should be composed of the professors and other instructors, those who have knowledge of educational matters, not in the sense of pedagogical, and who are most competent in their special fields to represent this interest before the community. This body should also be elective, but elections should be for short terms, two or three years without the possibility of immediate reelection, so that the professional office-holder would not result. To this body the function of passing upon all matters of educational policy, of financial administration as applied to the departments, and of electing professors and instructors would adhere. Election to this body should be by the faculties or divisions, etc. If these two bodies are called "trustees" and "council" respectively, we should say the trustees would represent the university in its <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page178" title="178"></span>general financial relations, the council would represent the university in its educational relations. Neither should be subordinate to the other, but each should have its own distinctive function. The officers of these two bodies may be designated as appears best, whether president, chancellor, rector, or other terms, would make little difference, provided the functions of these officers were solely those of presiding, as they should be. If it becomes necessary that an officer of one of these bodies be delegated to perform certain functions in relation to the community, these officers should be appointees of each body, separately and then jointly. If a financial agent were needed by the trustees, that would be an office to fill; if a man to represent the learning of the university were needed by the council such a man should be selected by that body, but should have that place, either for the particular occasion, or for a period of time, or for life, as seemed wise. This arrangement would abolish the present anomalous position of president, who has often had no qualifications other than that he has been a successful or an unsuccessful preacher, or even that he happens to be an officer retired from the service of the government and has sufficient time on his hands to give to the institution without pay. With the third and fourth sections the writer is in general accord. I believe, however, that if vacancies or new positions were open to competition of a dignified nature and not to be filled by direct recommendation of president or professor without competition the university would benefit. I am not aware of a university in this country to which a man, dissatisfied for any reason with his present position, may apply for a vacancy, except in the lowest grades, without injuring his chances of election. All that can be done is to use personal friendship to have one's name attracted to the presiding and electing bodies. The present scheme works, therefore, towards the creation of friendship cliques, and of bossism because of this. Much good would result from the creation in the university of visiting boards for each department of five or ten instructors and professors, such boards to be constituted of specialists in the same departmental line who would act as advisers on numerous matters of appointments, of departmental increases, etc., and whose verdict would have no earmarks of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page179" title="179"></span>favoritism. Such a board would be of assistance to the council in estimating the financial needs of a department as well as its educational needs, and the university would benefit in many other ways. It must be understood that such boards can not perform their functions in a proper way if they visit the university in a routine and perfunctory manner. Each board must have the interests of the special subject at heart, and be willing to give the advice best suited to the occasion. If the selection of these boards be left to the head professors in each department or be due to his nomination, little or no value may be expected of them. The selection of such a board should be left to the council, after the submission of ten to twenty names of specialists by the department, with specifications of their work and abilities. Boards of three to five members, each of whom is paid traveling expenses or an equivalent, would probably be of as great value in the selection of instructors, lecturers and other officers as well as in helping to make known the wants and needs of the department. Were some scheme like this carried out, it would probably result in the making of departments rounded, rather than lopsided because of the individual preferences and research lines of the head of a department, as is so often the case at present. There would also result an advantage to the good, capable instructor, who at present is sometimes in the subordinate position because the head of the department has little sympathy with this instructor's research, since it is not closely identified with his own. I have no suggestion to offer which appears to me to be better than that regarding the automaticity of salary increase. I do not feel, however, that such an automatic increase would help any but the time servers, unless degrees of inefficiency were taken as methods of retarding this advance. Too often we find a man elected to a professorship, who gives up advancing and the performance of advanced work once the position has been secured. The tenure should be for life, it is true, but the teaching of students for a few hours each week should not be counted sufficient for routine advance when we consider that some of these men spend most of the time not occupied with classes on the golf-field, etc. The writer has been in an institution from which good men were permitted to go to other institutions because the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page180" title="180"></span>time had not come for the automatically set financial advance, and because it would have been extra-routine to give more salary to the ones who had not served the full time that others had served. Salary advances are not the only ones to be taken into account. To many a man the giving of an extra assistant is of much greater value, and should be given fuller consideration in any change in the conduct of the university. With (5) and the accompanying note (9) I am in full accord.</p>

    <p>Reforms of any kind should not be instituted suddenly, and a reform can not take place suddenly, but I am of the opinion the naturally slow motion of university bodies will be an automatic check on too rapid change. I therefore think that the attempt to reform, however fast it may be, will do no harm. You need not worry about the evolution being too rapid. I do not feel competent to answer proposition (1). I agree most heartily to any change which puts an end to the conditions mentioned in the latter part of note (3). I believe the professors or officers should have a large say-so in the election of their president. I think though that necessarily his position will seem more dignified than that of the professor. (3) seems to me to be extremely desirable. The interrelation between the various courses of studies, loss of time due to overlapping or repetition of the same subjects, demands an understanding by the teaching staff in any specified department and an intelligent and responsible carrying out of the mutually agreed upon policies. It seems to me that this arrangement demands a very close connection between related departments such as mathematics and physics, physics and chemistry, etc. I notice that the wording of (3) includes such a suggestion. (4) I agree with in every particular. Footnote (8) is of the greatest importance. New men should be given to understand that they are on approval until the department is satisfied with their personalities and competence. I do not see any pleasant way of solving the condition necessitating dismissal, but in my opinion the weaknesses of our profession are mostly due to the retention of men lacking ability and character at this point. On the other hand, the ability and character of a worthy man should be quickly recognized and adequately com-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page181" title="181"></span>pensated by promotion and salary. The present conditions in general discourage the good man and treat the unworthy one too well. Another point of importance is the burden of administrative and purely clerical work borne by the teaching staff. I do not feel that I exaggerate in saying that teaching efficiency would be certainly more than doubled if the teachers could be relieved of purely clerical work. Why should a professor of Greek be an enrolling officer, or a professor of mathematics be in charge of the book department? It seems to me that there is a woful lack of true efficiency in the usual arrangements in institutions of learning. "There should be as much flexibility and as complete anarchy throughout the university as is consistent with unity and order." Perfect.</p>

    <p>I think you have decidedly the right idea in this matter of university control. Recently our various alumni clubs have been discussing engineering-school curricula. I have attended every one of these special club meetings, and am more than ever impressed with the idea that good would come from an increased participation of our alumni in the government of the institution. I am therefore strongly in favor of the suggestion you make in section (1) of your reprint. For several years the entire staff of our department has had weekly meetings; every one expresses his opinion without any hesitation and the common judgment of the entire staff determines the policy of the department. Every other department here is under the autocratic control of the department head. This system has resulted in making our general faculty meetings almost absolutely sterile. I, therefore, believe that you are right in section (3) of your reprint. Authority in educational matters is the worst thing possible as it seems to me.</p>

    <p>I think your scheme embodies most of the features of what it has seemed to me desirable to evolve towards. I certainly think that the autocratic president with practically absolute control is a very undesirable thing to have in a really developed university. It would take a long time to discuss a scheme like this with reasonable fulness, so I shall not go into the matter generally. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page182" title="182"></span>With reference to one point, however, I think your scheme for appointing professors would be improved if the matter were left entirely to what you call the board of advisers in paragraph (4). I should not let the department nominate the candidates. I think in that way very often a department's own ideas of what is desirable in this way is apt to be what is least good for it. Any power of such appointment by the department is very apt to make weak departments stay weak or become weaker. I think the department is sufficiently represented if it forms one third of the board of electors.</p>

    <p>I have long felt that a system of administration has grown up in this country that is now not well suited to the present conditions that surround our educational institutions. It seems to me that the present head is handicapped in many ways and an institution is very fortunate if it has an executive officer that is able to do well. So much is demanded of him along certain lines and so little in others that the man who approaches the nearest to the ideal leader is the least likely to secure the appointment or to wish it. In other words, the fault I have to find is not so much with the presidents as the method of their choice and the duties that are laid upon their shoulders. Of course, my look is from the view-point of the professor, but, after bearing that title for more than a quarter of a century, it seems to me that the plan you offer is one that should appeal to every one—trustee, president and teacher alike—as a possible way out of a dilemma that is growing more serious from year to year. In this land of the people it would be more in accord with the national spirit to have our higher educational institutions with their whole head and front faced toward the rising sun of a highly intelligent well-grounded democracy.</p>

    <p>Your plan of "University Control" I have read several times and I find nothing to criticize. It is a logical and practical plan which recognizes existing conditions and proposes only reasonable modifications. Its application would seem to be not difficult, and very desirable. The plan in sections (3) and (4) does not apply so readily to the college or smaller institutions, but the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page183" title="183"></span>important parts of the plan are fully applicable. It might be well, in section (2), to specify somewhat the duties of president, since that office is the point of present friction; and since the chancellor is the new official, to differentiate his duties from that of the president. A little elaboration here will be helpful and prevent many questions.</p>

    <p>I like very much, in a general way, the plan of university control which you propose. Our universities differ so much in plan and growth that what would be applicable to one could hardly be applicable to all. But the development from college to university has been rapid and it is full time the college faculties were given both more autonomy and more power in the administration. The danger of autocratic control is not overstated and has often led to very serious trouble. It is very desirable that the president of a university, if there be one, should be in touch and have the full approval of the college faculty. I think that one result of such a plan as you suggest would be a more gradual development, and the new schools taken into the university would be better assimilated. The trustees in my judgment now have entirely too much control, many members of the board being selected entirely for financial reasons. This has been greatly modified, however, of late years by the practise of electing new trustees from among the alumni. I am in favor of very careful selection of college professors by the faculties, with the assistance and advice of selected alumni; life tenure for the college professor with removal for cause by his colleagues; a president responsible to the university, and a chancellor or other presiding officer to look after the business matters of the university. I don't suppose any system that can be devised will even approach perfection, but we have outgrown the college president in a great many of the old colleges which are really universities in all but the name.</p>

    <p>I am heartily in accord with your suggestions, excepting only some detail in number (5); but that is unimportant for the principle is wholly right. The only objection to the suggestion of joint committees is that men can not be secured who will do <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page184" title="184"></span>the work required of trustees. The reply to the objection is that men unwilling or unable to devote the necessary time to familiarize themselves with the work should not be elected to boards of trustees. No self-perpetuating board of trustees will remain efficient—there must be the sense of responsibility to some authority outside. This is especially true of college trustees, for as the boards are constituted a large proportion of the members are unfamiliar with the work which they are supposed to supervise. The college or university should be a republic, not an autocracy. The president should not be loaded down, even if he so desire, with details—he ought to have more time to prepare the public addresses which compose so great a part of his duty. The faculties should select their own officers and nominate candidates to fill vacancies in their number—all subject, of course, to confirmation by the trustees. The faculties should be directly responsible to the trustees, who should be required to make themselves familiar with the work which the professors do.</p>

    <p>Your proposed method of university control has much to commend it and in general has my cordial approval. It is so obviously superior to the prevalent system of presidential autocracy that almost every one who has seriously studied the problem can heartily wish it practical experimental test. It seems to me that one thing much needed along reform lines is representative democracy. There should be some method by which any professor might have open access to trustees, regents or governing board; a fair opportunity for the development of his professional manhood, self-respect and efficiency. Under existing conditions of an absentee governing board, and autocratic administrative head responsible only to said board, these rights are checked and repressed at every point, and a truculent, adulant spirit encouraged by various bribes of favoritism or conciliation. It is of small effect to establish "foundations to encourage teaching" so long as a system is tolerated which strikes at the root of self-respecting manhood and scholarly freedom. It is to be hoped that by healthy agitation along the lines you propose there may result a real evolution in university control which shall conserve the ends above suggested.</p>
