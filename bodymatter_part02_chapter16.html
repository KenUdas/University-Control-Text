    <h2 class="calibre9">XVI. Letters from State Institutions in the Central and Western States</h2>

    <p>Having risen from the ranks, so to speak (having been a professor in this university until three years ago), I appreciate all the difficulties of the situation. Since taking up the work of my present office, my relations with the members of the faculty have been unusually pleasant. I have been often surprised that there would seem to be a spirit abroad that members of the faculty were indicating a greater willingness to trust me than to trust their colleagues. I note what you say in footnote 3, of page 2, beginning with "There are often several trustees," etc. The desire of certain members of the faculty to secure an unfair advantage over their colleagues by securing the active interest of certain regents, an attitude unfair because these regents do not listen to more than a favored few, presents, in my judgment, the most serious problem of the college president at the present time. I note what you say about the permanency of professors' positions. As a matter of fact in our university there has not been a single instance of any one losing his position through any act or recommendation of mine. This includes all positions from deans to graduate assistants. The only removals of sufficient importance to make an impression upon my mind during my administration were as follows: One professor who had received a year's notice of his discharge, the notice being given nine months before my taking office. One fireman discharged by the superintendent of grounds and buildings for cause. One superintendent of farmers' institutes discharged directly through the board of regents against my recommendation, but not over my protest. The history of this institution shows that the tenure of office of a professor is very much better than that of the chancellor. I accepted my present office with full knowledge of these conditions. Though receiving now two and one fifth times my salary as professor of chemistry, I am actually saving less money. This comes about as follows: The position requires a house that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page252" title="252"></span>would have a rental value of a thousand dollars a year, while one worth $300 per year sufficed for me in my professorial chair. The sentiment in the state demands that I work in the way of lectures, etc., gratuitously for the public. As professor of chemistry I had permission from the university authorities to conduct a private practise worth about a thousand dollars a year. Expenses other than rent make the difference. Furthermore, I was building up a name for myself among chemists. Under present conditions a chancellor "out of a job" in the west has no standing with any one. I would call your attention to the fact that since I have been in office nearly twenty per cent, of the presidents of tax-supported institutions have resigned or been removed. I have sometimes thought that if the president could be placed somewhat like the British premier—have his professorship secure to go back to when some one else could better command the confidence of the regents, the faculty, the alumni and the public—the situation would be better for all concerned. The difficulties of the president's situation have been greatly increased by agitation just such as you are now conducting. It is not necessarily to be condemned on this account. It matters little what happens to an individual president, or to an individual professor, provided that we evolve a satisfactory system for the future. It matters, in fact, very little whether the institutions live or not, except in so far as they are necessary to the well-being of the state and humanity at large. It seems to me, however, that at the present time the president's position is an impossible one. The members of the faculty, the alumni and the public are demanding that in building up the institution he be more than a god, while in the control of the internal affairs of the institution and the direction of those forces which are necessary to build it up, he is to be somewhat less than a man.</p>

    <p>Probably there is no state university in the country which is more a state institution than the University of Nebraska. We are regarded as a part of the "state government," and in making provision for the work of the state the legislature considers the state university as much a part of the state government as the governor's office, the office of the secretary of state, the state <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page253" title="253"></span>treasurer, etc. By turning to the state constitution you will find a section which says:</p>

    <blockquote>The general government of the University of Nebraska is under the direction of the Legislature vested in a Board of six regents to be styled the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska, who shall be elected by the electors of the state at large and their term of office shall be six years. Their duties and powers shall be prescribed by law.</blockquote>

    <p>So you see that the control of the university is fixed by the state constitution and can not be changed. In fact, we should not like to have it changed, as it gives us a board of control which is free from the dangers incident to an appointive board. Allow me to quote a few paragraphs from the law controlling the state university. Thus:</p>

    <blockquote>The Board of Regents shall have full power to appoint their own presiding officer and Secretary and they shall constitute a body corporate to be known as the Regents of the University of Nebraska, etc., etc.<br/><br/>

The Regents shall have power and it is hereby made their duty to enact laws for the government of the University, to elect a Chancellor who shall be the chief educator of the institution, and the prescribed number of professors and tutors, and a steward, to prescribe the duties of all the professors and officers, and to fix their compensation. They shall have power to remove any professor or officer but only upon the proof of written charges, and after affording to the person complained against an opportunity for defense.<br/><br/>

The University may embrace the following departments: (1) a graduate college; (2) a college of arts and sciences; (3) a college of agriculture; (4) a college of engineering; (5) a teachers college; (6) a college of law; (7) a college of medicine.<br/><br/>

The regents shall be empowered to establish in these several colleges such chairs of instruction as may be proper, and so many of them as the funds of the University may allow, etc.<br/><br/>

The immediate government of each college shall be by its own faculty, which shall consist of the professors therein, but no course of study shall be adopted or series of text books used without the approval of the Board of Regents.</blockquote>

    <p>From the quotations I have made you will see that a number of the things to which you refer are taken care of in the organic law which controls the university. Now I may make the following comments on your paper, referring to your numbered paragraphs: (1) In this university the "corporation" is in fact the people of the state represented by the board of regents on the one hand, and the legislature on the other. (2) I can not agree <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page254" title="254"></span>with you in recommending that the "professors or officers or their representatives" should elect a president of the institution. Many years ago I maintained this view myself and advocated such a practise. However, after having had experience as acting-president (or chancellor) I have found that there are insuperable difficulties in carrying out such a plan. Our institutions are as yet too young and too much in need of guidance to permit us to adopt such a plan. During the periods when I was acting-president or acting-chancellor, it was my practise to keep in very close touch with the faculty, and I am told by those who have watched the development of this institution that during those periods the university made a most promising growth (I do not refer to numbers, but to procedure) and that many things which we now have, found their origin in such periods. This fact suggests to me that the executive of the institution must keep in close touch with his faculty, but my observation has been that in institutions, as they now are, with professors who are so largely interested in but one line of work, it is necessary that there should be one man in the institution who can think out consecutively the intricacies of the developmental problems that present themselves to every growing institution. For this reason, I feel that it is necessary that there must be one guiding mind. You may say that the election of a president by the professors would provide that, but we all know that in large faculties the election of a president if left to the professors would not be likely to result in the selection of the best executive. I wish it were not so, but unfortunately it is true that in any such selection not the good of the university as a whole would dominate, but the result would be determined by votes which had quite too much of personal and selfish considerations back of them. (3) Your statement in paragraph three is one that I fully concur in. It has been the practise of the University of Nebraska to give complete autonomy to each department. In fact that is one of the peculiarities of this institution. The head of the department is the one in full control, and his decisions stand. Where he is wise he counsels with his helpers (associate professors, assistant professors, instructors and even assistants) and the success of departments is largely measured by such willingness to counsel with those who are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page255" title="255"></span>helping to do the work. However, I feel that here, as with the institution as a whole, there must be one person whose final decision is really final. (4) As to the autonomy of each "school, division or department," that I have referred to above. The faculty which controls each college in this institution elects its minor officers, members of committees, etc., but it does not elect its professors, and it does not select them as a formal faculty. Nominations to professorships in this institution are by committees appointed by the chancellor from related departments. Commonly the dean of the college is a member of such special committee, and then the heads of related departments are added. They confer with one another and finally make their report to the chancellor, who then lays it before the board of regents, who by law are empowered to make the formal election. In this institution election to a full professorship is always for life, and as a matter of fact an election to associate professorships or assistant professorships is usually for life. Formerly we had a limited election for all but those who hold the title "professor" (including "head professor"), but the practise has largely come to be what I have indicated above. It should be said here further that many of our professors have become so by slow promotion from instructors. Such promotions have been both in title and in salary, but in no case do we have any "automatic" promotion or advance in salary. (5) The device of a "university senate" to legislate for the university as a whole has worked very well here. Now and then there has been danger of the encroachment of the senate upon the jurisdiction of some faculty, but there always have been enough alert men to stand up for the rights of the faculty and no difficulties have arisen. In so far as the inside control of the university is concerned, this university senate is coordinate with the regents, and neither body encroaches on the ground of the other. Yet it is recognized that in the end the regents constitute a higher body than the senate. I like the general idea in your footnote 9, where you say that "professors and other officers should not be distracted from their work of teaching and research by administrative politics." This has brought, with us, the practise of having much faculty administrative work done by standing committees appointed once a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page256" title="256"></span>year. I quite agree with you that no college or university can be "a simple democracy." That is unworkable, largely because the professors are appointed for a different purpose, and each man if he is doing what he should is giving his time and strength and thought to his teaching and his investigation. We have reached quite a satisfactory condition here in which the judicial work of each college is left to the dean and to a committee which assists him.</p>

    <p>I think I agree with proposition (1) in its essential idea, though, so far as state institutions are concerned, I believe the people should elect all the trustees. If the institution has not influence enough to result in control by its friends in this manner, it is hardly probable that the institution will have much merit, or in any large way touch the interest of the people. In a republican form of government I believe that all its educational influences should be directly amenable to public opinion, and in any discussion of the propositions which you raise, my statements are influenced largely by this thought. It would, I think, be a very great misfortune to separate our educational institutions from our public official life. They must become closer in a government which depends upon education for its basis. I have no sympathy with any philosophy which would tend to set our teachers aside, making them amenable only to their own thoughts and ambitions. I would not have our universities become cloisters. There must be action and reaction between the educational institutions and the people, and we may as well understand that, one time as another. If our universities are alive, this influence will be for the good. If they are dead and only running for the purpose of placing learning into archives as a treasure trove for the learned, there is now no good cause for their existence. (2) might, I think, be a possible condition, though I can see no certain gain. Your statement that the president's salary should not be larger, his business more dignified, nor his powers greater than those of the professor, is not tenable in our form of government. If such is to be the case there is no object in having the position. It may be that there are institutions in which the president is not worthy of the institution, but it is a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page257" title="257"></span>strange mind that believes that there may not be some man more capable than others, and more worthy to be looked up to as a leader. I should have little use for our government if, in our desire to teach equality, we should gradually tend to the stagnant calm of uniformity. (3) is perhaps axiomatic, except the last sentence, which, of course, is only a guess, inasmuch as the size of the group will depend wholly upon the nature of the investigation and instruction which must be undertaken. With (4) I can not agree. Such a plan could only be effective at a time when our schools reach a condition in which there are offices of uniform graduation, out of which grades it is possible to rise only through death. In other words, our universities fall into a civil-service condition. A university should be a larger thing than that. If all the officers, major and minor, in a department were expected to remain constant in their positions, your proposition would be rather tenable, but it would be a very unfortunate condition when our colleges and universities reach such a status that a man once elected becomes a fixture in his little notch, with neither hopes or fears. Your statement that the "same salary should be paid for the same office and the same amount of work" sounds good, but at present it is un-American and I hope always will be, because there is no such thing as the same office or the same amount of work. A biologist can not think of one animal, or even a man, doing exactly the same amount of work as another, or as accomplishing as much, or even having the desire to do so. Our universities should not join the union. The present great incentive to American students is to gain the approbation of their fellow men, and this applies as well to a college professor or an instructor as in the business world. All the conditions which you desire in this paragraph can be reached under a management of the university which is amenable to a direct vote of the people. As to (5), I believe these features are all reasonably well attained under the present organization of our state colleges and universities, and each institution should be amenable to the direct vote of the people interested in that particular institution. If we are not already on that basis, our form of national government indicates that we must eventually come to it. The initiative and referendum will, in my opinion, be active here as else-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page258" title="258"></span>where. It will be all right for our educational institutions to initiate reforms in themselves, but it should be up to the people to decide whether such reforms are good or not. Being a biologist in training and thought, I have no desire to see our educational institutions adopt any plan to live to. These institutions must of necessity be a matter of evolution, and any plan which is adopted now will, in large part, be a dead one in the future, and in the meantime cause much unnecessary trouble in getting it out of the way. There was a time when our educational institutions had so many rules that a professor or a student could hardly live in the institution. We have now reached a time when our rules of life represent daily conduct amenable to public opinion. I should not care to help foist any sort of a scheme on the educational institutions of our country, which, if adopted by many people, would tend to put educational institutions into a strait-jacket again.</p>

    <p>Propositions (1), (3), (4) and (5) are good and doubtless necessary for every large institution of higher learning. Details of make-up and of application will necessarily vary in different universities, especially in tax-sustained as compared with privately endowed institutions, and where the university is the culmination of the entire system of public education supported by taxation. With proposition (2), however, I do not quite agree. My opinion is based, of course, upon experience in, and a somewhat intimate knowledge of, conditions in only one institution. The president of the university should be elected by the trustees after securing the opinion or opinions of the professors upon available candidates. Professors might nominate a candidate or candidates. The president's powers from the standpoint of the whole institution should be greater than those of professor; his duties are more varied, and his responsibilities cover a broader range. His salary should also be larger, but not twice or thrice that of a professor, probably not more than twenty-five per cent, larger than the salary of professor. His position should certainly not be more dignified than that of the professor. One of the chief objections to the American university president is the fact that he has been in some cases, and may be still, an autocrat, an abso-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page259" title="259"></span>lute monarch,but with propositions (3), (4) and (5) well put into practise, he could establish a very limited monarchy only. The application of (3), (4) and (5) will constitute a rather broad constitution whose limits he can not well exceed. Moreover in the conduct of the affairs of his department of knowledge, the professor, or many of them, would rather be responsible to a president than to a committee of his colleagues. In the management of departmental affairs by a committee of professors, the practise of pitting one interest against another, or log-rolling, is a positive evil. In short there creeps in too much "politics," and the temptations to develop "political" methods become too strong. Or perhaps it is more like this in many cases: one of the children of a family resents being subject to official control or discipline by his brothers and sisters, but is much more amenable to outside authority. In short, I believe at present (though open to conviction) that an American university should have a strong president, <i>i. e.</i>, strong in his knowledge of educational questions and a master of details on the business side of university administration. If it is not possible to combine the two in one man, there should be associated with the president a man who is master of business details and whose presence and activity are constantly conspicuous within the limits of the campus. The kind of university president most bitterly complained of, and justly too, is the narrow autocrat who refuses to consult or even to hear the opinions of his professors, save a selected few who become for personal reasons his henchmen. With your propositions (1), (3), (4) and (5) carefully worked out and put into practise, such a president as the foregoing can not be possible. As to salary let me say that men should never aspire to this profession because of the large compensation offered, if such were ever the case, but love of knowledge and love of the work should be our slogan, not love of the things the large salary could buy. True, salaries are distressingly small at present in our universities. Probably they should be equal to those of judges of the higher courts and of the higher officers of army and navy.</p>

    <p>There are in every faculty a few well-balanced men of ordinary judgment with whom, if there were a sufficient number, a work-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page260" title="260"></span>ing democracy might be formed, but such a group in a university is very limited. The remainder or majority of the ordinary faculty I should class under three groups. (1) A few men, essentially selfish, who want everything available for themselves, or the interests they immediately represent. They will resort to intrigue and Italian diplomacy to attain their ends irrespective of the rights and welfare of others. Their code of ethics is similar to that of a pirate. (2) Men who are active until their own personal desires are satisfied and are then indifferent to the welfare of others or the general welfare unless their own comfort is jeopardized. (3) Men who wish to be always on the side that will win, not from principle of right, but in the hope that some advantage will accrue to them. With a combination of this kind a strong executive with more or less autocratic power seems necessary. I do not regard the autocracy of the president or overlord as so much to be deplored as the petty tyranny possible in the hands of a head of a department. The reason for this lies in the fact that an abuse of power in petty matters is much harder to bear than greater things which are shared by a larger group. In my opinion, the place where a test of democracy should be made is in the smaller unit. It must be admitted, I think, that a large share of the teaching and no small amount of productive scholarship falls upon those occupying subordinate positions in any department. The greatest element of protection afforded such men is that above their autocrat there is another autocrat who is jealous of his delegated power and will resent such abuses. Any gross abuses will or should be corrected instanter by the overlord, but an effort to correct petty abuses is more difficult. Any subordinate desiring to force the correction of a series of petty abuses risks his position and may be his educational prospects by attempting in the most open and legitimate way to have the ruling of the head of his department reversed.</p>

    <p>(1) Looking at the matter from the point of view of the state university I should think that the nearest approach possible to your "corporation" would be to have a large part, say one half, of the trustees elected by the alumni. (2) I should replace the second statement by—his position should be at least as dignified <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page261" title="261"></span>and his salary at least as great as that attainable by any professor in his faculty. His powers should be clearly defined and limited, as should those of all the officers of the university. (This would of course give greater power than at present in some ways, less in other ways.) I consider it bad that in many institutions the only hope of promotion and the only manner of promotion, after one reaches the professorship, lies in devotion to executive work. (3) One can hardly make the organization quite so simple in a large university. There must be something corresponding to colleges and departments and schools within those colleges. It may happen that the same department or school would come into more than one college. (4) I am inclined to the belief that this plan may be needlessly centrifugal. The appointment by the president, subject to the approval of the college, would seem to give sufficient democracy. In the smaller units the matter is not of vital consequence. In the manner of electing to the professorships I would grant the president at least a nominating power, or else a veto power, with restrictions, as in our national and state governments, upon both nomination and veto. This same feature might play a part in other matters of government. I do not see why all professors should be paid alike. Length of tenure and reputation should be taken into account. Financial autonomy is probably desirable for the colleges; will be a necessity in the near future. (5) This division does not seem to recognize sufficiently the difference in the character of the work of trustees and professors. Educational planning is the function of faculties under competent leadership. The carrying out of these plans and particularly the providing means for that carrying out is a matter that naturally falls to the trustees. Consultation between trustees and representative faculty committees is undoubtedly desirable, if only for the sake of a better understanding all around. There should be as complete unity and order as is consistent with flexibility and growth.</p>

    <p>I fear I am not very expert on the question of university control. I find it hard to judge how far the good and bad results I see are due to the system or the men in each case. I don't care for the chancellor idea, and I think that a good president is a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page262" title="262"></span>great asset. The president should be a man rather well advanced in years, with a reputation as a scholar and man of affairs. He should represent, so far as one man may, the ideals and purposes of the university and should have such a character as to command respect. Such a president may be, I think, a great unifying force, and if he is wisely chosen there is no doubt, I believe, that his moral standards will be higher than the composite of a miscellaneous faculty. On the other hand, I most heartily agree that professors should be chosen only after they have proved their ability as scholars and teachers, and that once chosen they should have a free hand within all reasonable limits. I believe in the practical autonomy of the departments, and I think that when a new man is to be chosen, those most nearly concerned should have their say. Care should, however, be taken to avoid the possibility of departmental cliques refusing to let in new men just because they are new, and would bring new ideals, or possibly differ in opinion from some of the old guard. Given the autonomy of the departments, and a strong university senate, we have perhaps a sufficiently democratic system. If the president does not know the proper field for his activities, but tries to do work which should be done by others, it is difficult to control him; it is also difficult to control faculty members who err in the same way. It may be worth while at times to put up with some things for the sake of harmony: in fact, we all have to do this in our dealing with one another. Perhaps, after all, the root of most of the existing trouble is in our public and its ideals. "We do not always know how to choose good men for presidents, or to keep them when we have got them. Faculties want more power because in various cases they feel that they are superior in knowledge and ideals to those who actually have charge. It would seem, however, that with power to choose the best men, this feeling would largely disappear. I think there is a natural desire (I am sure I have it) to look up to some one, but just because of that, it is irksome to look where that some one should be, and not find him. In our university here the president, whatever else may be said of him, has kept things straight and honest for twenty years, when it was extremely difficult to do so. It would be difficult to overestimate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page263" title="263"></span>the value of this service, and it seems to me quite impossible to imagine any such result with a system of changing faculty control, or even with a president not possessing large powers.</p>

    <p>(1) While I think your plan would apply to an endowed university, it would be difficult to apply it to a state university. (2) Same as (1). I think the salary of the president should be larger but never more than twice as large as that of a regular professor. (3) Yes. Very good plan. (4) Our plan is to have the executive committee elective, but the dean is appointed, and in a state university I am inclined to think that this is a good plan because that gives a fair representation of both governing body and faculty. (5) Yes. Good.</p>

    <p>He who believes in democratic control yet realizes the difficulty of attaining efficient and economical operation—economical in reference to the faculty member's time and energy—should find little in the proposed plan to question, and many suggestions to commend. The method of selecting trustees and the special committee for nominating professors are most admirable suggestions for any form of control. On the other hand, the important question as to who shall control the apportionment of funds which are not automatically distributed is not discussed. Personally, I am still more fearful of the results of a pure democracy than of a temperate monarchy. With the democracy I imagine that I can foresee two main parties within the campus gates—progressives and conservatives—alternately in control, tempted to strengthen their forces by electing to professorships men of like views. Likewise the deans and the presidents would be subject to the criticism of giving preference to members of their faction. I am inclined to believe that scholarship is most likely to grow under those conditions which require the least active interest in university policies.</p>

    <p>Your first suggestion concerns the general organization of the governing body of the university, and, as I take it, involves the principle that this body should consist of people whom the institution serves and of those who serve the institution, and that this body should delegate its administrative force to a board of trus-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page264" title="264"></span>tees. As you suggest in your footnote, the application of this principle to state universities would be difficult to make. In a measure, however, the conditions surrounding a state university meet the requirements of your principle, and to that extent I should say that the principle is sound. I do not know how practical it would be in the case of privately endowed universities to institute such a scheme of control as you suggest. I imagine that it would vary largely with the institutions. My general opinion with regard to this matter is that the governing body of the institution should, as nearly as possible, represent the ideals and purposes of the community which it serves, and that any available means which would insure this representation might be used. For instance, in the case of Columbia, situated, as it is, in a very large city, I should deem it quite possible to carry out such a plan as you suggest with regard to the formation of the corporation governing the institution. On the other hand, the institutions situated in small communities would probably find it considerably more difficult to effect this type of organization. I hardly know what to say about the question of having a chancellor of the type that you suggest. Having grown up under a system of university control which places such a large emphasis upon the head of the institution, I find it difficult to conceive of conditions in which a centralized control might not exist. So far American universities have found it almost necessary to have some one who is able to represent the institution to the outside world and secure from it the necessary funds for maintenance. This is true even of state universities, where the head is obliged in most cases to go to the legislature and from it secure the necessary money for the running of the university. If it should come to pass that the states would provide an automatic maintenance from taxation for the support of their institutions, this need would not exist so strongly for them, and a chancellor of the type suggested in your first paragraph would not then be so necessary. If I analyze your second suggestion correctly, it involves the principle that the governing officer, the president, should be directly responsible to the faculty and should be its representative. Concerning this point I find myself in entire agreement with you. I also think that you are correct in your <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page265" title="265"></span>analysis of the conditions which have led up to the present state of affairs, wherein the president of the institution exists as a force largely outside of the control of the faculty of the institution. This would seem to be fundamentally wrong. The really essential part of any educational institution must be the faculty. No other body within the institution, it would seem, is nearly so competent to judge of the needs of the institution as the teaching force. The final result of the present conditions must of necessity, it appears to me, be the production of a faculty body largely without initiative or power and the end result to the educational institution, inevitably a condition wherein it would exist without much influence upon the community. If we are to have strong and forceful faculties, they must be placed in such a position as to have responsibilities and be obliged to meet them, not only towards the students who come to them, but towards the communities which their institutions serve. It would seem no longer possible for an educational institution to withdraw itself from the life of its community, and only those will be successful which articulate themselves vitally with the people who support them and whom they serve. The intimate connection of the faculty with the administrative control of the institution, however, brings up one very practical difficulty, that is, that in taking faculty members away from the special work for which they prepared themselves it is necessary to ask for a division of their energies, and that, of course, must result to some degree in a lack of effectiveness. To avoid this, I am of the opinion that it will be necessary for institutions to train up men whose interests largely lie in educational administration. These men could be familiar with the aims and purposes of university work, and yet not be obliged to engage in teaching. They could constitute the educational machinery of the university to be under the direct control of the faculty, and in this way relieve the faculty members of a large amount of the details of administrative work. I should think, however, it would always be necessary for the faculty to retain control of the administration and to delegate only the details to the administrative machinery thus constituted. At the same time there should be provided, to as large a degree as possible, assistance of a clerical and technical sort, which <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page266" title="266"></span>would relieve faculty members from the necessity of attending to details of work which could be performed as well, or better, by those who are not especially trained for teaching. In this way I believe it would be possible for teachers to train themselves intensively in their particular line of work and yet be in a position to concern themselves with the general welfare of the institution and to contribute towards its administration. Your third and fourth suggestions concern, as I take it, the details of organization within the institution. Here I find it more difficult than in the other instances to answer specifically your questions concerning the organization, for the reason that to a considerable extent this must depend upon the nature of the institution itself. It seems to me that you are correct in calling for the existence of compact bodies of men all interested in a somewhat limited field of work, with opportunities to meet and talk over the whole field in which they are mutually concerned. Here I have repeatedly urged the formation of sub-faculties constituted of the members of the teaching force concerned with a particular branch of work. For instance, I have suggested that all of those concerned in biological instruction in the university should be constituted the biological group of the general faculty, to be endowed with the powers of an advisory body in relation to the whole faculty and with administrative powers in regard to the biological work of the school. Just how far this might be carried in the existence of our present system of school faculties, I am not sure. It seems to me that the present organization of the educational institutions into schools and departments has to a large extent justified itself and that by modifications of this it will be possible to do away with such difficulties as are now inherent in this form of organization. I am not sure, in the scheme which you suggest, just where the unit of organization which you propose would come in relation to present systems of organization. Is it to be superimposed upon these, or is it to entirely take the place of school and departmental organization? I am of the opinion that the suggestion which you make with regard to the establishment of these units of organization contemplates the formation of largely independent bodies with limited interests and slight correlation with similar units within the institution. Undoubtedly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page267" title="267"></span>great freedom of operation should be allowed, not only for the individual within the institution, but also, the groups of individuals constituting a department or school. Whether it would be possible to endow these with such autonomy as you propose, extending even to financial control, is much of a question in my mind. I have been impressed with the need for better correlation between the parts of the university, rather than with the increased independence of them. This may possibly be due to the different nature of the institutions with which I am connected, but it has always seemed to me that there is a great need for more definite correlation between the different classes of subjects within the institution, and for that reason, in the scheme of organization which I proposed, I suggested the extension of the organization downward from the university council into the schools and departments by a system of representation which would carry the same individual from the council into the school and into the department as a member of various committees. Such a correlation as this I presume you intended to provide in your fifth suggestion, and it might be that what you proposed would be sufficient, but I am rather of the opinion that there is need for a machinery which will bring together more intimately the different interests of the school. There are so many things that could be said on this subject that I hardly know whether I have said too little or too much—certainly we are all vitally interested in the question, and much good must come from the agitation which now exists.</p>

    <p>To me the presidency of an American university seems both an anomaly and a contradiction. All the presidents, I believe, have first been professors. Had they been successful professors, they would have remained professors, for a professor may be rated successful only so long as he is a professor. The fact that a professor is willing to renounce the calling to which he has devoted say the first forty-five years of his life together with all his energies, argues <i>eo ipse</i> in my opinion that he is not satisfied with himself. Gildersleeve, of the Johns Hopkins University, is my idea of a professor, antipodal to him is-----. As a professor he was not a success—as a university president he may have to fill <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page268" title="268"></span>from twenty to fifty professorships, such as are held by Gildersleeve. In these selections will he strengthen his own hand, or will he be as sincere and virtuous as college presidents in their orations would have other people be? On the other hand, the fact that university mismanagement is so obvious to all and that we continue to suffer therefrom, proves too well that professors are incompetent in practical affairs; the meagerness of their salaries is a mute witness of this; and as faculties they certainly can not direct to the best advantage the business transactions pertaining to large institutions. There is need of a business manager. This work must be directed in part by a competent head. If you call him president, insist that he be a man of worth, sincerity and intellect. He should be able to obtain endowments, and his home should be one of the social centers of the community; his salary should be say five thirds that of a professor. To offset the too great power he now enjoys and from which the professors suffer, it might be well to have the deans elected yearly by vote of their respective faculties; abolish the senate which is a "go-between" between the president and board of trustees, on the one hand, and the faculties, on the other; have a board of trustees, consisting, say, of the president, the deans, five members appointed by the alumnal body and five other members.</p>

    <p>I agree most heartily with essentially everything you say in the proposed plan. Good luck to you in forcing it through dim eyes and muffled ears! Something like what you have outlined has got to come to pass unless the clear-headed who can see the present situation lose heart. Whatever salvation comes lies in that direction. The only thing that can defeat it, besides the blind plodding of those who have not thought through the situation, is the love of power of boards and president, who are now in a position of authority and who, like the captains of industry, are reluctant to relinquish anything. There are two points that would seem to me to be overlooked in your plan. The first is, that deanships will probably be a necessary part of the university regime, even under ideal conditions. Greater differentiation and consequently more autonomy of departments and schools, as the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page269" title="269"></span>university grows, are not inconsistent with the unification of related departments and faculties, each with its own executive officer. The university must progressively become a larger organism. The units of interrelation of parts will have to be individuals. Hence, deanships, rather than committees and councils. The deans should be elected by the faculties concerned. The second point has reference to student cooperation in university matters. Our biggest problem, at least so far as I can see, is to have students to feel that they are responsible parts of the great organism. For their sakes and for the health of the university as a whole they should have committees elected by themselves and have representation in the university senate with at least advisory power. I suspect that the reason they have not such representation now is the result of a false analogy drawn from the state, which prevents minors from active participation in affairs of adults. Another reason why students are excluded from representation in university questions is that colleges and universities have carried unto themselves customs which were developed for grammar and high school students. I hope that you will somehow get your plan so thoroughly before the university men of the country that it will produce conviction.</p>

    <p>On the whole I agree with you completely. I believe in autonomy of the university and of each of its departments or divisions. What I have to say, however, has reference to state universities only, for I have no experience in others. In our particular case, I think a chairman of a board of trustees should be chancellor. His duties are largely perfunctory anyway. He shall preside at various functions when degrees are conferred; he shall represent the institution when necessary at the functions of other institutions of similar character; he shall be consulted in the election of members of the faculty and in the policy of the institution. But I agree with your second paragraph exactly. I am. fully committed to the German method and think that the president should be chosen for a year only. I think, however, that his salary, on account of the increased expense to which he will be placed in the matter of entertainment and the like, should be at least one thousand dollars greater during his term of office. I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page270" title="270"></span>believe that the board of trustees should be paid. If chosen for political reasons and compliment they would certainly be less expert, and likely to leave the management of the institution to two or three; who, again, will leave it to the president and so establish an autocracy, which we so much deprecate. I agree with (3) and the first and second sentences in (4). I should hesitate to leave the election of any professor to the university senate after approval by the department concerned and the committee specified. The University of Iowa for twelve years has been following more or less closely the University of Chicago in its administration. The relation of the latter to the Rockefeller fortune caused Dr. Harper to organize the whole institution on the department-store system. He had head professors and all that. I understand that the new administration is getting rid of this artificiality and restoring autonomy as rapidly as possible. I agree with (5) in the thought that the senate shall not be in any sense a plenum, but shall be a joint committee of the whole. Generally speaking, I agree with your article throughout.</p>

    <p>I have known of the election of a president of a college by trustees most or all of whom possessed little "schooling," such trustees relying on their own impressions and popular recommendation instead of the counsel of educated men of experience. Some of these elections proved most unfortunate, leading to forced resignation. The plan of selecting professors by a president or by trustees without consulting some or all of the faculty is most unfortunate and humiliating to those who have had experience in the institution. It serves as a wet blanket on the cordial cooperation which ought to prevail. The plan you propose could not fail to be an improvement on the plan now usually in vogue.</p>

    <p>The fundamental principle of your plan, as I see it, viz., that the <i>ultimate</i> control of university matters should be in the hands of the faculty, has my hearty approval. I am rather inclined to think, though, that the greatest efficiency demands the delegation to the president of greater powers than I think you have in mind. I am a strong believer in centralized authority and responsibility <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page271" title="271"></span>in government—in which I see no danger if the man having such authority is directly answerable to the people (or faculty).</p>

    <p>I believe your suggestions are in the main eminently sound and workable. Many of our institutions are certainly in need of a change from the present chaotic conditions resulting from the ill-defined functions of the different bodies. At the same time, as you say, the boss system is utterly out of place in the university.</p>

    <p>I am entirely in sympathy with the point of view of your article in <i>Science</i>, and with some of the proposed remedies for the evils that have arisen under the present autocratic system. In many places, the faculties have lost all interest in the direction of the institution because they have lost all power. This is the case in many places. As to our western state universities, it does not seem wise to lodge the election of the trustees in the hands of the people. As long as our college presidents can find nothing better to do than devise schemes for attracting larger freshmen classes that they may get more money, and more money that they may get more freshmen, there is little to be hoped from them.</p>

    <p>When your article on university control appeared a few years ago I was much pleased with it. And I take great pleasure in saying that your ideas still have my hearty approval. I appreciate them now, perhaps, more highly than ever, because of my six years' experience at ------ , whose administration for most of that time has been, in my opinion, inefficient and corrupt beyond the conception of any one who has not lived through it. And I have seen many things in university administration elsewhere which were outrageous in their nature and could never have occurred under the form of government which you espouse. Affairs at ----- became so disgraceful and so trying to decent men, and therefore so detrimental to the prosecution of scholarly work, etc., that I concluded last summer not to endure the institution any longer. So I resigned my position and accepted a subordinate position here, in an institution and department managed by gentlemen. And I continue exceedingly glad of having made the change.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page272" title="272"></span>I believe the scheme you have outlined would not only give a democratic government to our universities, but would greatly advance the cause of higher education in America. It has seemed to me that the Swiss and German universities which have no president whatever run much more smoothly and are far more conducive to scholarship than our own. At present we have at our university a system that I believe is especially unfortunate. You probably know what the system is. I might simply say that I believe it is a clog to the advancement of those departments which desire to advance beyond the ordinary gymnasium or high-school ideal. I believe your third proposition is admirable and might well represent a unit in the general organization in choosing representatives for administrative purposes. I am in hearty accord with your entire proposal and would be pleased to see some practical results follow its publication.</p>

    <p>I heartily approve of the general scheme proposed.</p>

    <p>1 have long been in favor of such a plan as you propose. I have some question as to the dominance of departments as such. The absolutism there is often as bad as any other. A group of cognate departments as a large unit—instead of a single department—would serve better, in my judgment, even though the number of individuals included might be large. The "delayed democracy" in university government can be defended only on the grounds of immediate gain in efficiency. Its influence on faculties has cost the country and the universities some important leadership.</p>

    <p>It seems that it would be reasonable to grant much larger powers to the faculty. It is found here that the president can be away from the university for weeks at a time without in any manner affecting the work of the institution. In his absence the secretary of the board of regents acts as the financial officer—and does the work in a most efficient and agreeable fashion. As the president in large universities never visits classes nor knows anything personally about the individual instructors and professors, it is difficult to see that he has any real educational function. With his financial and educational work gone, there <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page273" title="273"></span>would be very little for him to do. All committees here are appointed by the president and virtually have to report to him before each faculty meeting, thus making them largely his instruments rather than the instruments of the faculty. It occurs to me that you have not, in your paper, suggested a plan for the division or apportionment of funds to the various departments of instruction. Here is the place where the president has his most difficult work. Whether a president appointed by the faculty could carry out the wishes of a majority without most seriously offending some of the departments is a little doubtful in my own mind. Might it not come to this: that the heads of all departments would appear before the regents and the man who was the best talker get the largest appropriations for books, apparatus, etc.? I believe that one of the most important things to urge at the present time is the organization in each university (where this has not already been done) of a university senate which shall represent each and every teaching department, both of the liberal arts and the professional schools. The powers of this body should be gradually strengthened until all educational policies should be in their hands, and also as you suggest this body should elect representatives to meet with the regents. Another important move, it seems to me, would be an organization of university faculties for the entire United States. This organization should hold annual meetings to which each university would send delegates to represent the faculties, not the regents nor the presidents. It is well known that the "Association of American Universities" is merely an association of university presidents. This organization very carefully avoids the discussion of some of the most vital things in education and educational policy. University presidents are far more interested in securing large numbers of students than are the faculties. Hence they are unwilling and afraid to handle the question of intercollegiate athletics. They are not generally anxious to fill their faculties with men who will outshine the presidents themselves, hence they are often content to appoint mediocre men when a better salary schedule would secure far better material. It seems to me that an "Association of American College Faculties" would do much for the advancement of higher education in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page274" title="274"></span>America. This organization need not have any power at all. But the power would come in time. If such an organization should recommend to boards of regents and trustees various reforms, I believe that some of them would be carried out very soon and that much good would be done. As the organization became older its recommendations would have greater weight.</p>

    <p>I trust that your timely formulation will hasten the day when the autocracy of the president shall largely give way, in our smaller colleges as well as in the universities, to the more democratic control you propose. I heartily agree with Dr. Paton and President Van Hise that the principal function of our colleges and particularly our universities should be to foster the spirit of scientific research. This being true, the main thing to be accomplished by a change from our present system is the establishment of a better atmosphere for research and for productive scholarship. The present grind of teaching, lack of adequate equipment and lack of sympathy on the part of some executives do not furnish as yet the idealistic research environment which the great Strasburger anticipates that our wealth and youthful vigor and unparalleled resources will ultimately bring us; when that time comes, he predicts that American science will "Sehlag ganz Europa tod." A most admirable part of your plan, it seems to me, is the making of the department, or small division, the more or less autonomous unit of organization. But this departmental unit might, under a more democratic organization, prove to be, just as it is sometimes now, a veritable graveyard for research aspirations, with a fossil at its head. So that, as you intimate, the idealistic university is, after all, mainly a matter of men; brainy, inspiring men to head the departments. It is perhaps due, more than to any other one cause, to the fundamentally trained, sympathetic, productive scholar at the head of a department to create about him the proper atmosphere for research. Such a man can inspire in plastic youth the ambitious desire to sail on unknown scientific seas, even under the most trying circumstances of lack of sympathy and appreciation from the autocracy. There need be in such departments no lament that our youth are becoming so commercialized that they no longer are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page275" title="275"></span>attracted by the scholar's life. The high-salaried research professorships you mention will furnish to such departmental heads a goal worthy of their most conscientious effort. Hence the great wisdom of your suggestions as to care necessary in the selection of professors and heads. Only the productive scholars of well-rounded training and proved worth ought to be elevated to such high responsibility, to endure as you suggest for life; or at least until retirement at sixty-five. It does seem to me, however, that nomination of professors by the department, subject to approval by its board of advisers, and to final election by the university senate, is safeguard enough, without having to risk a veto by that body of often unsympathetic business men, the trustees. The latter, as I take it from your plan, are created primarily to care for the property and finances of the university; while matters of administration and educational policy ought to be, it seems to me, in the hands of the faculty, who are undoubtedly the most vitally interested and in closest touch with university conditions. One step in the appointment of professors according to the plan proposed, if strictly adhered to, may possibly result disastrously. Jealousies and lack of breadth of view natural under the circumstances would often prevent the elevation of members of a department to professorships in their own department. In such cases, where a head professor had died, for example, and the department thus lacked a strong guiding hand, would it not be better to have nominations come, not from within the department itself, but say from the board department advisers? I am wondering also how the very important matter of distribution of annual departmental budgets would be handled under the democratic system of university control. The senate as a whole would probably be too unwieldy for this matter; the executive committee of the senate perhaps insufficiently informed on money matters. It may be that the joint executive committees of the senate and trustees, though undoubtedly liable to clash at times, could best handle such an obviously difficult and delicate matter. It seems to me, further, that in two matters—the legitimate enlargement of departments and the creation of new departments—the democratic control might work less efficiently and less expeditiously than the present autocracy. If, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page276" title="276"></span>however, the democratic body would early agree to a wise limitation of teaching hours for professors and instructors, then enlargement of departments would doubtless logically follow an increase in the number of courses and students. Perhaps the creation of new departments would depend largely on increased income; but the faculty as a whole would doubtless prefer to direct this extra income toward increase in salaries or toward the ever-insufficient departmental allotments. The chancellor's office would undoubtedly be especially useful in the solicitation of endowments; while the short-lived president-rector, the presiding officer of the senate, would probably still find himself possessing considerable power and influence, with much educational and administrative work to supervise. The present danger to educational freedom of our highly centralized administration is great; and your solution of the problem by the injection of more democracy into the government of our universities, in spite of the acknowledged "anarchistic" and "nihilistic" tendencies of our faculties, undoubtedly offers the true method.</p>
