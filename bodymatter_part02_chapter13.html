    <h2 class="calibre9">XIII. Letters from the University of Wisconsin</h2>

    <p>In response to your letter of December 1, I have to say that I am very reluctant to give an offhand opinion with reference to a comprehensive plan for the organization of a university constructed without much reference to present conditions. If I have any capacity in educational affairs it is along the lines of what to do with an existing situation rather than what should be done provided the slate were clean. Without going into a detailed discussion of your plan, it strikes me that its chief weakness is the enormous costliness in time required of the instructional staff for administration. So far as my experience goes a chief cause of complaint of professors is the amount of routine work which is required of them. You propose to have them take over the main responsibility of administration, both educational and financial, leaving the executive officers and trustees small authority. Faculties should have responsibility for educational policies. Educational and financial administration should not be required of them. I imagine if it were possible to inaugurate your scheme in a large university, it would break down of its own weight; and that the institution, because of the necessity for efficiency, would be obliged to relieve the faculty from the responsibility of administrative work.</p>

    <p>I prefer an entirely different arrangement for university control than the one outlined. (2), for example, might draw the elective body into political movements which might be very dangerous. The idea of a university senate which you develop has always appealed to me, and from what I have seen of the way it works in one place or another, great good is accomplished by it as well as great economy of time. (3), relating to the unit of organization, I deem a university necessity. The selection of a president in my judgment is best carried out by the governing board of trustees. If the board has the interest of the institution <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page203" title="203"></span>at heart, as they usually do, the greater likelihood is that they will receive as well as search for advice and information which will enable them to make a choice for the presidency of the institution in correspondence with its broad needs. The selection of professors in my judgment is best carried out by the president in consultation with the deans and the various professors who are likely to have charge of fields which are more or less closely related to that professor to be chosen. In general, the proposition of university control as outlined would tend to get too far away from the principle of placing the governing officers of a university in an independent position, and asking them to produce results by their powers of initiative. Believe me that I appreciate your motive in having these matters discussed, and I for one feel that you have done great good to university work and ideals by the stands that you have taken in these various lines.</p>

    <p>While the plan you propose is ultra-democratic and in keeping with the spirit of the age, yet I believe that the experience of American institutions is not yet broad enough to enable us to adopt safely at the present time such an ideal as you set forth. We have gone beyond the autocratic type of government, but efficiency in action can not be wholly sacrificed to a theory based on democracy. University control, as now managed by unwieldy faculties, is one of the most expensive administrative processes that can be found. Universities, as they increase radically in size, must undergo a change in organization. I question whether the evils of college politics in the selection of a president by the faculty are to be preferred to the judgment of governing bodies as they are now constituted.</p>

    <p>From the standpoint of my own academic experience, which has lain wholly in state universities, the scheme does not appeal to me as either feasible or desirable in its main outlines. One of the major drawbacks to an academic career at the present time is the conspicuous lack of great prizes to be attained through it, and this undesirable feature is accentuated in your scheme by withdrawing from the university president much of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page204" title="204"></span>authority and dignity of his office. You will recall the words of Sydney Smith, who, in protesting against a proposal to use the emoluments of the bishops of the English Church to increase the stipends of the minor clergy, urged that, although himself only a country curate, the prospect of one day becoming a bishop was worth more to him than the sixpence which he would receive were the emoluments of the higher clergy equitably distributed throughout his own class. Your proposition for a corporation to be the ultimate source of authority in the control of universities also seems to me ill adapted to the condition of state universities. I conceive it to be to their interest to stand as close as possible to the people whom they serve, and I am very pleased to see an immediate responsibility to the legislature of the state. It seems to me a better, ultimate control than would be a corporation such as you suggest. It is, of course, desirable that the alumni should take an interest in the affairs of the university and should exercise a considerable amount of influence over its development, but this we have been able to bring about in Wisconsin, and doubtless it can be or has been done elsewhere, without such intermediary body as you suggest. It is apparent that the above is written from the standpoint of a state university, and I can not express any opinion as to what may be needed or desirable in private foundations.</p>

    <p>Your outline would increase the importance of the school, division or department, and diminish the authority of the president and regents or trustees. In this institution the department already has considerable autonomy and, at least in my own case, I have seen no reason to complain of misuse of authority by president or trustees. In the case of a state university such as this, I think it impossible as well as inadvisable for the state through its legislature to relinquish control to the extent suggested by you. In regard to some of the bad procedures outlined in your footnotes, I think they are possible with the present system, but I think that almost any system is open to the possibility of developing bad conditions. In this university the unit of organization is, to a considerable extent, the department, which units are grouped in larger units as schools or colleges. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page205" title="205"></span>Each department is governed by a departmental committee consisting of the instructional force of professorial rank. Matters relating to salaries are discussed by the departmental committee. The chairman of the departmental committee is appointed by the dean, but only after consultation with the departmental committee, so far as that committee may deem it advisable. I believe that the plan suggested by you of a senate which should legislate for the university as a whole is decidedly inferior to the practise here, where the faculty of the whole university legislates for the university as a whole. The inferiority consists in the fact that the senate is a smaller body and therefore less democratic. It results in lack of understanding of university policies on the part of those members of the faculty who are not members of the senate. Therefore it results in lack of sympathy with those policies and lack of intelligent cooperation for the welfare of the whole institution. The control of the institution by the faculty at large requires more time in the discussion of the projects, and is therefore wasteful, so far as the efficiency of the faculty is concerned; but it has such important advantages (as just outlined), that the time lost in long discussions is much more than balanced by securing a large group of men intelligently working for common purposes. On this particular point I have decided opinions, because I am familiar with the conditions in two institutions, one having a senate and the other having faculty control, and I am thoroughly convinced of the correctness of my position.</p>

    <p>While I think that we are nearly all agreed that there are many matters of university control which certainly need improvement at the present time, nevertheless it is a difficult matter to formulate satisfactory plans for such improvement—especially any plans of general application. As you have obviously realized, the problem is different for the state universities than for the endowed institutions. The university of to-day, furthermore, is a big business concern, and I fear that there are reasons why the state universities, at least, will have to remain constructed upon somewhat such lines as are used in the conduct of large business operations in general. I might say a word briefly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page206" title="206"></span>on your several topics.—(1) While agreeing, in a general way, to your proposition, I think it would require a very considerable modification to better the condition of state universities. It is very desirable in my opinion that the alumni should have a considerable influence in the affairs and policies of the university, but I doubt whether, in the case of the state institution, they can be given any greater power than that exercised by every voter in the state, except in so far as they are free to influence public opinion, and in this way the legislature or other controlling bodies of the university. The present plan of appointment of the regents by the governor is far from ideal, since, at best, it is difficult to keep the board free from some political bias, and, at worst, the regents and, to some extent, the university may be used entirely for political abomination. (2) I agree with you in so far as believing that the faculty should have a greater say as to elections to its positions and to promotions within its membership than it enjoys in most institutions at the present time. Too commonly the power of appointment and advancement rests entirely in the hands of the dean or president, as the case may be, with only a nominal check in the way of approval by the regents. (3) The idea of departmental organization meets my approval, but the matter of separate endowment could probably not be worked out in state institutions. Undoubtedly, departments might often be allowed to accumulate separate funds more than is done at the present time, though I think this is not without its grave dangers. (4) I believe in as great democracy as possible within the department, but I am of the opinion that too great a gap between the position of instructor and professor, as it obtains in Germany, for example, tends to produce a very undemocratic state of affairs. Furthermore, if we may judge from many instances in German universities, it too often results in a man working hard until he has established himself in a professorship, after which he accomplishes practically nothing. (5) I agree that the departments or divisions should be as independent as is consistent with general welfare, but that so long as human nature remains the same, there will have to be a strong supervisory power in order to produce the greatest efficiency and economy. Examples could be shown in several institutions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page207" title="207"></span>in this country where, in lack of such control, separate departments have grown independent, overlapping each other's ground and usurping each other's functions. This not only leads to waste of effort and loss of efficiency through lack of cooperation, but also to lack of economy on account of duplication.</p>

    <p>I am quite convinced that a greater number of trained scholars should have a responsible oversight of the development of our higher educational institutions than is now the case, but the means of bringing about such a condition are certainly difficult to formulate. Taking up your suggestions concerning university control in the order in which you have formulated them: (1) I doubt somewhat if a corporation such as you suggest would show much wisdom in the election of a board of trustees. I am inclined to think that a better board can be appointed by a responsible official such, for instance, as the governor of the state, than is likely to be elected by a loose corporation. I should somewhat prefer to have a corporation elect one individual as chancellor and let him appoint a working board to act with him. This would center responsibility and probably conduce to efficiency. If the members of the board were elected for long terms subject to recall it might be feasible for a loose corporation to elect one or two new members each year. (2) To a board of this kind it would seem to me that the professors or officers of the university, or other representatives, might nominate two or three persons for the position of president from whom one could be selected to act in this office. It would seem to me not unwise that the officer who acts as president of an educational institution should have a somewhat more dignified position and somewhat higher salary than the average professor, since he needs to act along broader lines in order to be equally efficient. (3) I quite agree with this. (4) This seems to me, on the whole, a feasible scheme. (5) This likewise seems to me feasible.</p>

    <p>Your outline for university control already contains provision for initiative, referendum and woman suffrage. By adding the recall you will have a complete insurgent program. As an insurgent living in an insurgent atmosphere, I presume I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page208" title="208"></span>should favor this program on theoretical grounds, but as a matter of fact I am personally pretty well satisfied with present conditions and am not at all sure how far I should be willing to go in the direction you indicate. In short, I have not made up my mind, and am therefore sending you no definite expression of opinion.</p>

    <p>I agree in the main with the ideas expressed in your statement. The problem is certainly much more difficult in state than in private institutions. A few reforms which do not require any deep-seated changes would have a most beneficent effect: (1) The inability of boards of regents or trustees to appoint or discharge any member of the instructional staff except on the recommendation of the president, who is alone to be held responsible. (2) Appointments in a given department should be made by the president only upon the recommendation of the department, except in the case of the appointment of a new head of a department, or the reorganization of a department. (3) Departments containing two or more full professors present a particularly hard problem. Each full professor may be supposed to be in full charge of a given field of work or "Gebiet," and the head of one branch of a subject should certainly not have any advantage over the heads of other branches of the subject in the same department. Each full professor must have complete charge of the work in his particular field. For instance, organic, inorganic, analytic and pharmaceutical chemistry should be absolutely coordinate, and the chairman should be elected by the full professors of the department. Appointment of the head of such a department by the administration can not be justified as the discontent and discord far outweigh any possible advantages. The real business of the faculty should be carried on by the president, and a senate of five to eight members elected yearly by the members of the faculty of full professorial rank and on which a man can not serve more than two or three consecutive years. A small number of this senate should be retired each year so as to preclude abrupt changes in the personnel of the senate. This will prevent too great a concentration of power in the president and the body is small enough to do effective work. The limiting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page209" title="209"></span>of the number of years of consecutive service will ensure absence of too much politics. This rotation is, in my opinion, essential to the success of the senate idea.</p>

    <p>The ends which are to be sought for improvement in university control we are all agreed upon, but as to the method of attaining these ends there will doubtless be great difference of opinion. Your scheme as outlined would work well if we had the right kind of professors in our universities. It is an ideal toward which we should strive. Greater responsibility should continually be placed upon the professors as they are able to bear it, but I must confess that at the present time I can not endorse your scheme for the reason that the composition of the faculties of American universities is such that it would not prove a success. We must get men of stronger character, individuality and genius into our universities before any such scheme as you propose will succeed, and to place entire control in the hands of the faculties as they now exist would make it practically impossible to get such men on the faculties as we ought to have.</p>

    <p>Concerning the first paragraph, I would say that the plan would apply well to state institutions, since the "corporation" would be representative of the people rather than of a temporarily dominant political party, and the directive influence of the "corporation" would tend towards continuous rather than discontinuous development. It is likely, too, that any trustee or regent elected by such a "corporation" would remain in favor, and consequently in office, as long as he served faithfully and wisely—a condition, or rather a conservation, much to be desired, since trustees, willing, working and competent, are few and far between. With the privately endowed institutions the situation is fundamentally different, since here the idea of trusteeship is dominant, the peculiar conditions of gift or bequest being paramount. I think it would be better to have your trustees elect the treasurer and have the faculty elect, or at least nominate, the chancellor. What the faculty needs is representation on every governing board. (2) There will be duties and obligations affecting the office of president that will require expenditures on his <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page210" title="210"></span>part not liable to those holding professorial positions. If some financial arrangement is not made to provide for these expenditures, the office of president is likely to go to one who is financially equipped; and financial equipment is not invariably compatible with democratic control. (3) The provisions of this paragraph are excellent. It is substantially the organization of the departments of this university and it seems to work very well. The only serious objection that occurs to me arises in connection with the securing of funds from legislative bodies. State universities rely upon the favor of the legislature, and as long as human nature remains what it is, the over-aggressive department is very likely to thrive at the expense of the department that relies for its support solely upon the efficiency of its work. (4) The suggested mode of procedure in regard to the election of professors seems promising. If executed with great caution—as you explain in your footnote—it would be a vast improvement upon the present method. But if carried out impulsively it would work an irreparable wrong. Would not a probationary period followed by a confirmatory election be safer than a direct life appointment? (5) The faculty of every university should have a committee that can meet with a coordinate committee of the board. This meeting should be held in open session—a session where the members of the faculty can be present; where they may listen to the presentations of their representative committee and where they may hear the discussions of the trustees thereupon. Such a session would do more to correct existing difficulties than any other agency. Moreover, I believe that the average trustee would be heartily in favor of such an arrangement.</p>

    <p>In general I cordially approve of your proposal. By this I mean that I regard the plan of university government on the basis of the principles involved in your proposal as altogether better than the present type of administration. I regard it as likely to secure in a far greater measure the highest academic results, and to make the career of a professor a more desirable and a more creditable one. I am more and more convinced that the evils of the present system are likely to grow, and that there <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page211" title="211"></span>is an evident necessity for a radical reform which, as you suggest, should, be gradually put into practise; but the principles should be carefully thought out from the first and systematically and thoroughly followed. Considering the proposal more in detail, I answer, in regard to (1) that to my mind the essential factor is to secure an elastic and democratic control of the university interests and not merely to relieve the faculty from troublesome administrative details. The second proposal I regard as the most essential of all; and I endorse cordially any system which will minimize the importance of the president, and bring the professors into direct responsible contact with the larger and permanent policies of the university. This almost inevitably requires some provision, such as your third one, for the relatively independent organization of the departments, and this in turn naturally requires a provision, such as your fourth one, for the election of professors by the faculty itself. In such a scheme, I emphasize very much the importance of a definite assignment of salaries, making the same salary for the same office and responsibility. All competition for financial favor should be removed; and any attempt to differentiate merit by financial favor is to my mind wholly unsuited to the academic life. I equally approve of your fifth provision, and indeed the several provisions are mutually complementary. It is but fair to add that the suitability of such a scheme is necessarily dependent upon the development of the university. It is, to my mind, much better suited to a well-established institution whose purposes are clear and whose clientele is established. In the smaller institutions and in the struggling ones of the west and south, it is fair to recognize that the presidential type of organization, which places the initiative in the hands of one person, has distinct advantages. It is also true that in such institutions policies are not so well fixed, and programs are subject to the uncertain approval of untrained constituencies. In such cases, it seems wise to sacrifice a desirable organization for the sake of the more immediate benefit. But this does not apply to the great institutions of the middle west and the well-established institutions of the Atlantic coast. It remains true that issues of this kind are more properly discussed in terms of the highest representatives <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page212" title="212"></span>of university organization; and speaking of these, I have no hesitation in expressing a most emphatic opinion endorsing the general principles and many of the details of your proposals.</p>

    <p>Your plan seems to me to embody the best ideas. It would certainly avoid a great deal of friction which is now seen in universities. At the University of Wisconsin, until last year, it seemed possible for the president and the dean of a department to elect, advance or replace a man without any one on the outside knowing anything about it until it was all done. Of course, their action was subject to the final approvement of the board of regents, but I think this board accepted in large measure the recommendations put up to it by the president without further investigation. Last year a committee on organization was appointed and several new features introduced, one of which comes very close to number (4) in your plan, making the advancement of instructors, etc., the action of a departmental committee. While I do not think my opinion is worth anything on this subject, I feel that the plan you propose is an excellent one.</p>
