    <h2 class="calibre9">IV. Letters from the University of Pennsylvania</h2>

    <p>As to heading (1) as I comprehend it the corporation would have no powers of controlling policies. In that case I approve of it. I should not approve of having policies controlled by so heterogeneous a body and one so ignorant of academic questions as are most alumni. I should approve of their having advisory powers as to policy, and direct powers in electing trustees, so that the latter may not elect themselves. (2) I am in doubt about the whole of this section. I think it would be better that the professors should nominate, say two men, to the trustees and let them elect, so that the faculties would still essentially make the choice, but the trustees have a part in the decision. If trustees are to have any usefulness their opinion should be of some value. I think if there is a president at all his powers, dignity and salary should be greater than that of a professor, as high administrative powers are rare and consequently of unusual value, and his duties, if conscientiously carried out, are more trying than those of a professor. Few men would accept them if they gained no added power or income and the position would otherwise be a sort of head-dean. I believe some such officer is necessary, in the present age, at any rate, but I do not think he should have power of appointments, but that these should come from the faculty, that is, from the unit-faculty to which the position to be filled belongs, as nominations, and be ratified by the trustees or other advisory board. I am inclined to think that the best way to hold the president in check would be to give him an unlimited term of office, but to give the faculty of the whole university power of veto by a two-thirds or three-fourths vote in any of his proposals that affect the general university, and perhaps to give the unit-faculties power to veto by a large majority vote—say four fifths, or power to demand that any policy affecting the unit be carried before the whole university faculty and voted upon; and then consider a veto the fall of the ministry. This would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page100" title="100"></span>probably lead to closer relations between all individuals in the faculties and the presidential policies and conflicts would be settled early by discussion rather than by quarreling. It would involve also that the faculty be officially apprised at all times of what is being planned long before it was done. This is rather half-baked, as I express it. I do think, however, that what we need is to encourage the development of enlightened and able administrators rather than to clip their wings. (3) I approve of this. (4) I highly approve having outside experts called in to decide the choice of professors and I believe this might be required in certain other matters. I do not believe it is possible to pay the same salaries for the same office. This to my mind has the fatal danger that prevails in the labor unions, with their limitations of productivity, and would interfere with progress. If one man is a greater and more important man than another he is worth more to a university than a lesser man, even though both do the same amount of actual university work. I should approve of having a certain percentage of trustees graduates of other institutions and, except in the case of state universities, have, say, half of them reside elsewhere than in the town where the university is situated. I would also require that four fifths of the trustees should themselves be university graduates of some sort. This would still leave some places to be filled by uneducated rich men who know nothing of a university's needs—but not a majority.</p>

    <p>I should say that the plan is an excellent one in theory, but whether we shall ever see it tried practically may be a question. Of course universities, like everything else, are a product of evolution. Such institutions in this country appear to have reached the stage where they call for an autocrat, precisely as it appears necessary to have a boss in city and state government. In process of time we may expect the important universities of the country to outgrow this condition of things, but precisely what will take its place no one can say. It is not necessary or desirable that all should be organized on one plan, and perhaps the autocrat may remain a permanent feature of some institutions.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page101" title="101"></span>I should very much like to see one or more of the universities of the country put into practise a plan of control along the lines that you have suggested. There is fortunately a rivalry so keen that the universities which best serve the community are going to be those that will most prosper, and service to the community depends fundamentally upon an organization which will attract and hold the best men to its faculties. I have seen thoroughly bad results under the head-professorship system and equally unfortunate conditions in departments largely autonomous, where a group of older men of similar sympathies are holding back progress with serious results. The difficulty is to strike the means by which a department may be left autonomous as long as its actions are progressive, but may be brought up with a firm hand when it appears that a group of its professors are working for selfish ends or are exhibiting evidences of servile incompetency. I am inclined to think that the best checks are through criticism freely expressed by deans and other administrative officers and by committees, and freely asked by the president. The university in which is possible such criticism and consultation among its administrative officers is most fortunate.</p>

    <p>Excepting in some minor details, and in the matter of the status of the president, I am entirely in agreement with you. Regarding the president, it seems to me that as conditions are changing much from time to time a longer tenure of office than that of the rectors of German universities would be desirable, and I think that for many reasons it is desirable that greater power should be concentrated in one technically qualified person than your scheme seems to allow. This need not run counter to your idea of a democratic institution, since the power is, after all, delegated from the faculty to the person selected by them for the position of president. An assurance of considerable tenure of office and a somewhat distinctly higher position, both in salary and in dignity of position, should, I think, be given the person known as president.</p>

    <p>I believe the reform in university administration which you propose to be a very desirable step in advance. Perhaps I may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page102" title="102"></span>be permitted to suggest an amplification in one or two points: (1) The meeting of the corporation for the election of trustees should not be under the chairmanship or influence of any of the trustees. Not uncommonly the meeting of a larger body when presided over by a member of the smaller directing body is merely a nominal affair, approving the proposition agreed upon beforehand by the members of the smaller body. The larger body usually does not take the initiative in any matter of importance whenever members of the smaller directing body take an active part in the proceedings of the larger corporation. (2) The selection of professors and instructors is a most important matter. In the past the selection has been intrusted to administrative officers who usually relied upon the judgment of one or two men prominent in the special field in which a vacancy had to be filled. In very many cases one and the same man had thus the power to fill the most important positions. Such a procedure must naturally lead to conditions somewhat similar to those found in "politics." A personal element will be of influence in the selection of men for professorships. There is danger that the man who is most frequently consulted will, perhaps against his own inclination, be forced to assume the role of a political "boss," and that the building up of something like a political machine will result. Men of a certain school will be preferred for the filling of the most important positions. The committee having in charge the selection of a professor should, therefore, as a matter of routine, consult a large number of representatives of a certain field of science, preferably representatives residing in more than one country, in order to eliminate any personal bias, and to effect a selection on the basis of merit. Such a committee should submit the names proposed by the various experts to the senate for final election.</p>

    <p>In the main I thoroughly agree with your views. We are certainly sorely in need of a revision of the prevalent methods of running universities. It seems that in most institutions the board of trustees do not look upon the faculty as the living part of the university, but as a lot of laborers who should be placed upon the same basis as "hired help" generally. There is cer-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page103" title="103"></span>tainly vastly too much politics in professorial life, and there is too much done to please certain interests, right or wrong. In fact there are so many evils and weaknesses that are so manifest in the administration of university affairs and so desirable to be corrected that one could write an elaborate thesis on the subject without seeking for material. This must be a matter of evolution and not of revolution. Your article is in the right direction.</p>

    <p>I think your plan of university control on the whole a very good one; but you have not stated how a university senate should be constituted and elected. Further, it seems to me that any nomination for professorship passed by the board of advisers should not be subject to the veto of the trustees.</p>

    <p>Your plan seems to safeguard very well the interests both of the organization and of the individual.</p>

    <p>I am in thorough sympathy with the plan of university control as outlined by you. Two factors which make for faculty incompetence, in the medical schools at least, are self-interest and the dread of unpopularity among colleagues. This is particularly true of the clinical men whose business interests are not always in accord with a university's interests and for whom popularity is a business asset. These two factors frequently stand in the way of advances of benefit to a university.</p>

    <p>I find your plan excellent, and approve of it. I beg to suggest that one indirect effect of the present system has not been mentioned in your indictment: namely, the policy of academic advancement of the man who draws the largest classes, rather than the man who does the best work. It has been my observation that presidential favor is frequently curried in this way, to the detriment of men whose ideals will not permit them to lower the standards of their work for popularity.</p>

    <p>I heartily agree with your sentiments as to a strictly democratic organization, where no one man, or group of men, can set themselves up as a dictator. The corporation, to my way of thinking, should consist of several groups of men chosen from different <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page104" title="104"></span>sources of supply. It should consist of, say, fifteen members, selected as follows: the university professors should name three, the alumni organization five, the state legislature three, the educational board of the state two and the board thus constituted elect two other members from the community at large. These should, with the academic council in joint session, elect a president and a vice-president for five years. The faculty should name the academic council to which the questions of policy should be referred, presided over by the president. The professors, assistant professors and instructors should be assembled into groups, which groups would annually elect a chairman, and preferably in rotation. His sole duty would be to preside at group committee meetings, transmit their communications to the academic council and sign bills and other documents where such signature is necessary. In other words, the chairman of the group would be executive officer of the group for one year. The salaries should be uniform for professors and assistant professors, and of a sum sufficient for their needs and proportioned according to the length of active and honorable service, beginning with a minimum and ending with a maximum. The recommendations for advancement should start in the group committees, pass through the academic council and end with the corporation.</p>

    <p>It must be apparent to most sincere and experienced observers of academic life in America that the present deficiencies in our universities are not so much a consequence of faults of organization as of certain fundamental defects in the dominant American conceptions of what the purposes and characteristics of university activities ought to be. The form of organization prevalent in the universities is an expression of the predominant characteristics of the men who are chosen to fill the influential positions. Men whose instincts are for practical life, rather than for study and the advancement of intellectual ideals and achievement, are chosen far too frequently. This is the chief source of weakness, since such men determine what shall be taught, how it shall be taught, the degree of freedom of research and of discussion, the aims which the institution sets before itself, in short the whole course of university policy. Such men admire the business type <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page105" title="105"></span>of man and try to imitate him; the result is that they have imposed on institutions of learning an organization better fitted for definite practical undertakings than for the diversified and largely disinterested activities of an assemblage of scholars. The system, in other words, favors the selection of men who lend themselves most readily to cooperative and directly practical undertakings—rather than of men who, like most true scholars, combine strong individuality with idealism. The evil is self-perpetuating, since almost all men will work effectively or ineffectively, according to the incentives offered; if devotion to study and research is self-penalizing, the number of men who vigorously and whole-heartedly so devote themselves is inevitably diminished. Hence, many university men deliberately prefer to perfect their capabilities in quite other directions than scholarship—even when they are not forced to do so—studying the arts of management, control, compromise, the technique of executive activity, and the like. Is it to be wondered at that the intellectual life of many institutions flags, that our scientific productivity is so far behind that of Europe, and that students of marked originality so frequently fail to receive the stimulus and opportunities they need for their proper development? Under conditions more favorable to the selection of superior men—like those hitherto prevailing in Germany, France or England—the tale would be a very different one. It is not that we lack the ability, but that it fails to realize itself because of a radically wrong basis of selection. I am well aware that there are many distinguished men in the American universities, but far fewer than there ought to be. The present organization of the universities, I repeat, is rather the expression of this deficiency than the cause of it. The fundamental cause lies in the prevailing temper and ideals of university men in this country. There are certain tendencies of American life—to a certain degree of all modern life—which a university should deliberately guard against and oppose. These are, many of them, to be counted among the more doubtful products of the democratic movement: the prevalence of mediocre or popular standards—i. e., those which the common man can reasonably hope to attain—an uncritical faith in majorities, a pessimistic estimate of the possibilities of individual <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page106" title="106"></span>achievement, over-emphasis of the importance of cooperative activity ("team-play"). A preference for mediocrity and a disposition to neglect, disparage or hinder men of pronounced genius arise from all this. The organization of the university should therefore encourage a liberal and enlightened individualism; the tendency to make men conform to fixed standards, whether set by academic authority or by what happen to be the fashionable prejudices of the time, should be frowned down, or, still better, laughed down. Under these conditions men of distinguished ability will be far more likely than at present to make their way into universities and to produce their best work. The existing organization of the universities over-emphasizes the managerial side for the reasons I have already briefly indicated. Hence I should favor a change in the direction of a general simplification and decentralization. With reference to the reforms you propose, my opinions are very much as follows. I refer to the numbered paragraphs of your article. (1) The professors should undoubtedly form part of the corporation; alumni and other members of the community only in so far as they show real knowledge of university conditions. Such a body could be depended upon to select suitable trustees. (2) The president should be elected by the professors from among their number for a fixed term (e. g.) four years. There should be no obstacle or limit to reelection; a good man would thus hold his place. (3) and (4) I favor all possible autonomy to schools, divisions, departments and individuals. Salaries of professors should be adequate and uniform. I am inclined to urge the adoption of a system like the Italian, i. e., election of the professor by men of reputation in his own department of learning, in his own and other universities. (5) I approve of all these suggestions.</p>
