## PROJECT CONTEXT

Introduction to Current Work

I have started a digital restoration effort on James McKeen Cattell’s University Control, published in 1914. Although a variety of paper versions are available, there is not clean and well-formatted electronic version. University Control can be downloaded in multiple formats on the Internet Archived, but the renderings are riddled with formatting inconsistences, misspellings, and poorly rendered markup, which is indicative of automated digitalization and conversion. Although it is with great appreciation that I could start with a good base document, I felt that the quality rendings reduced readability, particularly for those requiring assistive technologies.   During the restoration I have:

* Recoding all text using well structured HTML 5 and CCS 3.
* Included page numbers.
* Included sematic inflection in accordance with ePUB 3 International Digital Publishing Standards for universal design.
* Corrected formatting, errant marks, missing words, and typographical errors.
* Created a well-structured table of contents and page list for easy navigation.
* Linked references to and from end notes.
* Linked the glossary to text.

I am an armature hobbyist with the standards used. I will continue to make improvements and will eventually publish a Task Backlog for this project with known improvement needs. A list of files with descriptions is also forthcoming.

I have used Calibre to edit the source files and compile the ePub document.  Calibre is a open source product, with a constant stream of improvements and updates.  I have found using it excellent and recommend it for anybody interested in viewing and editing the source files.


## Future Work
My intent is to annotate the document and include additional content for context. I will create a separate repository for an edited and annotated version of University Control. I will also create a separate repository for well formatted ePub versions of the resources referenced in University Control.  It is my hope that the annotated version of the text along with the original source materials can be used by teachers and scholars of university governance, the history of educational administration, the progressive era in the United States, and related areas of study.

Additional sections may include:
* Biographical information about Cattell (timeline)
* Brief biographical information on the Professors Protest Literature authors
* Literature review of Professors Protest Literature
* Summary and analysis of Cattell’s proposal on University Control
* Summary and analysis of responses to the University Control (298 letters)
* Additional protest literature in the public domain
* Impact of this movement (New School of Social Research, Beard and Robinsons’ resignations and writing, AAUP…)
* Overview of the structure of the University sector then and now (number of universities, size od faculties, number of students, etc.)
