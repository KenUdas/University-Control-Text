  <h1 class="UC_heading1" >UNIVERSITY CONTROL</h1>


    <h2 id="uca4fuwjnywySpzesrIiPd8" class="UC_heading2">I. Historical Retrospective</h2>

    <p><span class="first_word">Bologna</span> and Paris were the archetypal universities from which all others have descended and from which they have in some measure inherited their present organization and methods. In the first decades of the twelfth century Irnerius lectured at Bologna on the civil law, and Abelard at Paris on philosophy and theology. There were at the same time other eminent teachers in those cities, and students were attracted from all parts of Europe. The students in a foreign city organized themselves into guilds for mutual protection and assistance in accordance with medieval custom. These were the first universities. The lecturers, who had previously taught as the sophists at Athens and the rhetoricians at Borne, or as masters of music, dancing and gymnastics teach to-day, also organized themselves into societies or universities. There were no endowments; no academic buildings. The professors lectured at their homes or in hired houses; the academic convocations were held in churches or monasteries. When there were difficulties with the city authorities or with their colleagues, a group of professors or students might migrate and found a new studium elsewhere. Thus in the thirteenth century offshoots from Bologna gave rise to studia at Keggio, Vicenza, Arezzo, Padua, Vercelli and Siena. Oxford, the third of the great medieval universities, was probably due to a migration from Paris in 1167.</p>

    <p>At Bologna the universities of students—who were men of maturity from all parts of Europe, as many as ten thousand at the end of the twelfth century, it is said—<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page4" title="4"></span>obtained control, lording it over the professors by means of the boycott. At Paris the students, organized into nations, were somewhat younger, and the professors, doctors or masters, as they were indifferently named, were in control. In one respect the conditions were curiously similar to the contemporary American university, for there was a college of arts of younger students, and professional schools of theology, law and medicine. We even read of an anticipation of present tendencies in that students had to receive the degree in arts before entering the medical school. About the middle of the thirteenth century there were established colleges of residence which were endowed as eleemosynary institutions for poor students, usually under the control of the church. In England the colleges were the property of the head and fellows, who had complete control of the establishment; on the continent they were somewhat less independent. In the course of time the differences became emphasized. The continental colleges became absorbed in the university and disappeared as halls of residence, whereas at Oxford and Cambridge the colleges practically constituted the university.</p>

    <p>It is truly remarkable that there should have been some seventy-five universities throughout Europe before the time of the invention of the printing press and amid the incessant warfare of those days. One may wonder whether love of learning may not have been greater, intellectual curiosity keener, then than now. The students, numbered by the thousand—legend puts it as high as 30,000—flocked to a university attracted by the reputation of a great teacher. The rich came with their retinues, while the poor begged their way. Irnerius at Bologna, Boscellinus and Abelard at Paris, Grossetête and Roger Bacon at Oxford, were followed by long lines of great men, teachers, scholars, founders of science.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page5" title="5"></span>My main concern with the medieval university is that it was extraordinarily unhierarchical, democratic, anarchic, in its organization. The university was then, as it now should be, the professors and the students. The professors, of course, had complete control of the conditions under which degrees were given and in the selection of their colleagues and successors. The doctor earned the <i lang="la">jus ubique docendi</i>; he was not employed or dismissed. There was an elected council and rectors were elected for a year or for some other short period. Only later there came to be a single rector for the entire studium. The whole paraphernalia of the modern university—endowments, buildings and grounds, trustees and president, heads of departments and deans, curricula, grades and examinations—were absent or subordinated. There were indeed all sorts of routine, customs and limitations, but the university, in an age of feudalism and of absolutism of state and church, attained a remarkable freedom, and its great performance was in large measure due to this freedom.</p>

    <p>It further seems to be the case that the waning of the influence of the university in the course of time was largely due to the loss of freedom. As the universities obtained endowments and buildings, as their governing bodies became organized, they lost their spontaneity and creative leadership. The great philosophers, scholars and men of science of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries worked in large measure outside the universities. Bacon, Hobbes, Locke and Berkeley; Descartes, Spinoza and Leibnitz; Harvey, Huygens and Laplace; Linnaeus, Buffon, Lamarck and Cuvier; Lavoisier, Priestley and Dalton, were not university professors or not primarily such. Newton was, but he relinquished his chair at Cambridge to take a position in the mint at London. The men of science of the seventeenth and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page6" title="6"></span>eighteenth centuries worked largely in connection with the academies of science, which were then established, and in the newly founded museums, observatories and botanical gardens. This movement is analogous to the contemporary establishment of research institutions outside the universities. There was too much dogmatism, formalism, discipline, routine, control, machinery—it might have been called efficiency if they had had the word in those days—in the university, and scientific men found greater freedom and stimulus in the academies, which, though under the patronage of the court, they themselves controlled.</p>

    <p>Toward the close of the eighteenth century the universities throughout Europe had sunk to a low level. Within a period of a few years as many as thirteen German universities became extinct—Mainz, Cologne, Bamberg, Dillingham, Duisberg, Kinteln, Helmstedt, Salzburg, Erfurt, Altdorf, Frankfort, Ingolstadt and Wittenberg. But the new era of freedom and democracy, represented and caricatured by the French revolution, gave fresh life to the universities. The centralized scheme of Napoleon aggrandized Paris at the cost of the provincial universities, which only just now are regaining their autonomy. In Germany the modern university attained its fruition. The University of Berlin, established in 1809, when the political fortunes of Prussia were at low ebb, played a great part in the regeneration of the nation. It was partly founded on the basis of the existing Academy of Science, as was the University of Munich a little later. It is possible that our newer research institutions, if placed under the control of men of science, may become the freer universities of the future.</p>

    <p>During the nineteenth century the German universities rivaled in their influence those of the medieval period. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page7" title="7"></span>The advances of democracy and of science have been the great achievements of our era. In the advancement of science and to a certain extent in the maintenance of a democracy of scholarship, the German universities have been dominant forces. In Germany the university is indeed the creature of the state and subject to it. But during the nineteenth century academic freedom and the independence and influence of the professor attained a remarkable supremacy. Any student who showed ability could become a <i lang="de">Privatdocent</i>; if he continued to advance his subject with sufficient distinction and did not starve to death in the meanwhile he became a professor. The professorship has been maintained as a position of dignity, honor and freedom. The professor receives his appointment by the decision of his peers and holds it for life. He may lecture about as much or as little as he likes, on almost any subject, well or poorly as the case may be, with complete freedom in the expression of his views; he is but little concerned with grades, absences, discipline, routine reports, committee meetings and the like; he gives much or little attention to his students as he may choose. The rector is elected annually by the professors. The curator, the representative of the government, the efficient man who runs things, is nowhere regarded as the intellectual or social equal of the professors.</p>

    <p>All this might be supposed to lead to abuses; but the result is there to be seen by every one—the great scholars and men of science, the contribution to national progress and to the civilization of the world. No efficient machine driven by the president of an American university can grind out such flour. I fear that the German university can not continue its great performance of the nineteenth century. This was doubtless more the result than the cause of the idealism of the people, now threatened with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page8" title="8"></span>submergence under wealth and luxury. The modern German university must have its fine buildings, must grow greatly in size. This is inevitable, perhaps desirable. Laboratories, libraries and collections are required on a scale not formerly imagined; there is danger, perhaps need, of more administrative machinery; and the more machinery you have, the more you must get. It seems that the professors now tend to form a bureaucratic guild, too greatly concerned with their own financial status, and too little with the welfare of the docents and associate professors, of the students and of the people. The Prussian ministry is interfering more than formerly in the selection of professors and the management of things. The German emperor, it is said, wants presidents in the American style—we could spare him at least one for each of the twenty-one German universities.</p>

    <p>It seems remarkable that in the bureaucratic little states which have since become the German empire the universities should have been centers of liberal scholarship and free personalities. But it is perhaps generally the case that the finest exhibitions of the love of liberty and honor are made under persecution or where there are contrasted conditions. It is really quite difficult and discouraging to play the part of an academic hero or martyr nowadays. One can do it better in Russia than in the United States. Thus a hundred professors at Moscow have recently resigned owing to some interference of the government with the liberty of the professors. In that country students and professors strike, and the government institutes lockouts. They take their liberties seriously, and the professors maintain their right to choose their colleagues and their deans and rectors.</p>

    <p>The historic English universities, Oxford and Cambridge, have been primarily groups of independent colleges. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page9" title="9"></span>The master and fellows are the college; they own the buildings and endowment and divide the income among themselves. They elect their colleagues and successors and of course their head. The headship is an honorary and social position with but few executive powers or duties. Government is by town meeting and committee. There have been abuses of the monastic system, and perhaps even now too much time is spent on details of management. But high standards of scholarship and conduct have on the whole been maintained. From among the resident fellows and from the students great men have been forthcoming in every line of activity. Probably half the leaders of England in statesmanship, scholarship, science, poetry, have come from its two universities, having together no more students than one of our larger institutions; and England has produced more great men than any other nation.</p>

    <p>The universities of Oxford and Cambridge, as distinguished from their colleges, have long had a few endowed professorships and have conducted libraries, but until recently they were essentially degree-conferring institutions. They are administered by councils elected by the resident teachers, but the ultimate control is vested, as is becoming, in the masters of art. The Church of England clergy have perhaps had more influence than is desirable, but their interference has in the main been confined to prescribing the conditions for the degree. In any case it is only a temporary phase, and a certain amount of conservatism is not so bad for a university. It would seem quite absurd to invest the ultimate control of Oxford and Cambridge in a self-perpetuating board, consisting of a score or larger crowd of business and professional men. The chancellorship is an honorary office, without executive power or influence, to which a nonresident graduate of distinction is elected. With the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page10" title="10"></span>specialization of knowledge and the need of laboratories, the colleges could not give all the instruction needed, and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge are becoming increasingly teaching bodies. Parliament has required the colleges to give some part of their income to the support of the university. The professors are usually nominated by boards of electors, consisting of men of distinction in the subject or in related subjects, partly from the university and partly from outside. I have never heard of the expulsion of a fellow or professor. That a professor's salary should depend on the favor of a president or that he should be dismissed without a hearing by a president with the consent of an absentee board of trustees is a state of affairs not conceivable in an English or a German university.</p>

    <p>Harvard College was founded in 1636 by the general court of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay and placed under a board of overseers named by the court. In 1650 there was established a self-perpetuating corporation consisting of a president, a bursar and five fellows, which, however, was made responsible to the overseers. In 1865 the election of overseers was transferred from the legislature to the alumni of the college. The Collegiate School of Connecticut, subsequently named Yale College, was chartered by the legislature of the Colony of Connecticut in 1701 and placed under the control of trustees or partners, consisting of ten reverend ministers of the gospel. In 1745 the corporation received the title of The President and Fellows of Yale College. Later the governor, the lieutenant governor and six senators of the state were added to the fellows; in 1872 alumni trustees were substituted for the senators. The College of William and Mary was chartered in 1693 by the sovereigns whose names it bears. Princeton, Pennsylvania and Columbia, chartered, respectively, in 1746, 1751 and 1754, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page11" title="11"></span>were placed under the control of boards of trustees, and, like Harvard and Yale, either at their inception or later, were controlled by the state and received appropriations from it. In my opinion it would have been better if the relation between the state and its university had been maintained.</p>

    <p>The colonial college was largely modeled on the Cambridge college; thus the form of the Harvard and Yale corporations—the president and fellows—was directly borrowed. At Harvard the corporation included the teachers of the college; there was much protest the first time an alumnus was elected a fellow when there was a tutor eligible. It would be interesting to trace—did time and my competence permit—the steps through which our colleges slipped from the control of the state and of the graduates and teachers into the hands of small self-perpetuating corporations, until we reach the most reactionary of all charters, that of 1810 for Columbia College, the provisions of which are as follows:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation">The said trustees, and their successors, shall forever hereafter have full power and authority to direct and prescribe the course of study and the discipline to be observed in the said college, and also to select and appoint by ballot or otherwise, a president of the said college, who shall hold his office during good behaviour; and such professor or professors, tutor or tutors, to assist the president in the government and education of the students belonging to the said college, and such other officer or officers, as to the said trustees shall seem meet, all of whom shall hold their offices during the pleasure of the trustees. <i class="calibre25">Provided always</i>, That no such professor, tutor, or other assistant officer shall be a trustee.</blockquote>

    <p>The careers of our colleges were checkered by political and church dissensions; thus, in the case of Columbia, the subordination of the professors is in part explained by distrust of their episcopalian tendencies. It seems <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page12" title="12"></span>that the organization of our colleges was influenced not only by the college of the English universities, but also by the English endowed public school, to which it came to bear a greater resemblance.</p>

    <p>The University of Virginia was established as a state institution by the legislature in 1819. Under the influence of Jefferson the continental university was to a certain extent followed; and both in educational and administrative methods there was much that was admirable—at least from my point of view. Under the general control of a board, the affairs of the university were administered by the faculty and its elected chairman, until after eighty years souls were once more sold for gold. The University of Indiana was established in 1820, the University of Michigan in 1837, as part of the public educational system of those states, the governing bodies being elected boards. Here was inaugurated a new movement in higher education, destined, I trust, to parallel the great performance of the medieval university and of the German university. The institutions of the Atlantic seaboard having slid into capitalistic control, there has arisen in the central west a system of higher education directly responsive to the will of the people on whose support it depends.</p>

    <p>Prior to the last quarter of the nineteenth century we had colleges and professional schools, but no university. Yale, it is true, first offered the doctorate of philosophy in 1860, and in the early seventies the degree was given by Harvard, Columbia and Cornell. But the graduate work of a faculty of philosophy was not organized or emphasized until the opening of the Johns Hopkins University in 1876, when there arose an institution nearer to my conception of what a university should be than any elsewhere in this country or than it has been able to remain. Buildings, administration and routine instruc<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page13" title="13"></span>tion were subordinated to great men who attracted from the whole country the students who were to be the future leaders. In the organization of the Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1893 a contribution of nearly equal significance was made in placing the professional school on a university basis. The past two or three decades have witnessed an almost incredible growth of our universities. Columbia has now 700 instructors, 7,000 students, fifty million dollars. In spite of the materialistic standards and autocratic methods of control which this essay emphasizes—perhaps overemphasizes with a view to their correction—the development of the American university, especially of the state university, is one of the greatest achievements of our people, promising moral, social and intellectual leadership and supremacy in the course of the present century.</p>

    <p>If here or elsewhere I have expressed opinions which seem lacking in appreciation of what is being accomplished in this country for higher education and for the advancement of science, this is only because it is not possible to put in each paragraph or even in a single essay everything that one believes. The most useful forward movements and the greatest men are subject to just criticism. It is only when the work has been accomplished and the men are dead that we may forget the faltering and the errors and eulogize the good that has been done. In our educational and scientific work, as in our business, social and political life, we must oppose with all our power the materialistic aims and autocratic usurpations which are the not unnatural accompaniments of the development of the vast resources of a new country and the passing from aristocratic to democratic control. As I wrote <a class="super_original" id="p01_c01_note01" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c01_note01">1</a> before the present democratic movement had gathered its existing force:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page14" title="14"></span>The applications of science—which in the first instance made democracy possible by supplying the means of subsistence with possible leisure and education for all—have in their recent developments enormously complicated modern civilization. Our methods of communication, transport and trade, of manufacture, mining and farming, have led to the doing of things on an immense scale. The individual has once more been subordinated, crudely commercial standards prevail, and control has been seized by the strong and the unscrupulous. Those of us who are not ashamed to profess faith in democracy regard all this as a temporary phase, which will only last until intelligence has developed equal to the complexity of the environment. The only real danger is that instincts may become atrophied before reason is ready to take their place.</blockquote>

    <p>The trust promoter and insurance president, the political boss and government official, the university president and school superintendent, have assumed powers and perquisites utterly subversive of a true democracy. The bureaucracy is defended on the ground of efficiency; but efficiency is not a final cause. To do things is not a merit regardless of what they are, and bigness is not synonymous with greatness. There is no ground for hopelessness. Of the things done the good may last and the rest may be eliminated; bigness may become greatness. The organizers of our huge corporations have in a way made history prematurely; these vast combinations were inevitable; the trouble is that they have come before we are ready to manage them. We have no evidence that people are less competent, honest and kindly than they were; it is the difficulties and the temptations that have increased.</p>

    <p>There is ground for maintaining that the methods of the business corporation and the political machine have been somewhat wantonly applied to educational administration in this country. On the one hand, educational institutions are not and need not become so big and complex as to require the sacrifice of freedom to supposed efficiency, and, on the other hand, those who are the university—the teachers and the students who are or have been under their influence—have far more than average intelligence. . . .</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page15" title="15"></span>In stating frankly views that are shared by a larger proportion of my colleagues than is generally supposed, I by no means wish to adopt the attitude of a pessimist. I know well from personal experience with what unfailing courtesy and ceaseless effort a university president may conduct the affairs of his difficult office. Much has been accomplished for higher education in the United States. As the industrial trusts will in the end be directed by the world's greatest democracy for the benefit of the people, so our educational system may give the material basis for an efflorescence of creative scholarship springing from a free and noble life.</p>

    <p>My own academic experience has been mainly in the endowed institutions of the Atlantic seaboard. My father was president of Lafayette College from 1863 to 1883, during which period the teachers increased from nine to thirty, the students from 60 to 300, and the property from $50,000 to $1,000,000. There the personal and patriarchal system of college control was exhibited at its best. It doubtless now flourishes in many small institutions throughout the country as in the English public schools. A man such as Mark Hopkins or Thomas Arnold has been the soul of the institution. As Matthew Arnold writes in "Rugby Chapel"</p>

<blockquote class="quotation">... to thee was it given<br/> 
Many to save with thyself;<br/> 
And, at the end of thy day,<br/> 
0 faithful shepherd! to come,<br/> 
Bringing thy sheep in thy hand.</blockquote>

<p>As a fellow at the Johns Hopkins University at the zenith of its great achievement, I had again opportunity to witness the system of presidential autocracy under favorable conditions. The university was dominated by one man who was personally responsible for and to its dozen professors and two hundred students. But the patriarchal system is of necessity limited to the small institution, and it is scarcely fitted to the democracy of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page16" title="16"></span>twentieth, century. In a residence of six years at European universities, I had experience of the educational system, but though I was assistant at the University of Leipzig and lecturer at the University of Cambridge, I was at that time indifferent to administrative methods. These have been increasingly forced on my attention since my appointment as professor at the University of Pennsylvania and lecturer at Bryn Mawr College, and for the twenty-two years during which I have been professor at Columbia University.</p>
