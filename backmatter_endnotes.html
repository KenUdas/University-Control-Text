    No sensible person would attempt to reform suddenly by a paper constitution a system which has developed in response to its environment. The boss in politics, the trust magnate in business, the university president and school superintendent, have probably conduced to a certain kind of efficiency and to an enlargement more rapid than would otherwise have been possible. What a community does is dependent on the men who compose it rather than on the laws under which they live. But a bad system may demoralize the cooperative spirit of the group and may select for it individuals who are not the most desirable. The danger of our present system of university control is that it tempts a man to play for his own hand and selects for academic work men lacking in character, individuality and genius.

    A large corporation of this character places the ultimate control on a democratic basis. The members would pay annual dues, and a considerable income would thus accrue. A large number of individuals would take an active interest in the welfare and development of the institution. In the case of the state universities the people of the state are in a sense the corporation with ultimate control, and it might be undesirable to establish an intermediate body. Still the state might delegate its powers to such a corporation, and a society of members of the university might be formed, even though the regents or trustees were elected by the people or appointed by their elected governors.

    The trustees or regents of an American university have absolute powers, but tend to delegate them to the president. They place a limit on the amount of money that can be spent and sometimes use their reserve powers even in matters of educational detail. When the corporation is small, as at Harvard, it may be in active control of policies. In the private chartered institutions it is usually large, its members having but little knowledge of educational problems or of the special university under their control. There are often several trustees who take an active, though not always a wise, interest in the university, and it is a delicate problem of the president to manage such trustees. One of the most serious difficulties of the present situation is that the president owes his office, salary and powers to the trustees and must obtain their favor, whereas he is not responsible to the faculties. The professor is likely to owe his office and salary to the president, and is sometimes placed in a position that is humiliating.

    It might or might not be an advantage to have a chancellor, such as exists in the British universities, a man of prominence in the community, who would obtain endowments and represent the university at public functions.

If, however, the president were elected by the faculties for a limited term and made responsible to them, the academic situation would be greatly improved. The argument of efficiency can be adduced in favor of giving autocratic powers to one individual, but the university is the last place where such system should prevail. It is neither necessary nor desirable that things be done in haste. Administrative details can be handled promptly by a clerk or secretary. Men and women should not be subject to the judgment or whims of an individual. Security, permanence, honor, the slow growth of traditions, are essential to a true university.

    Such autonomy is usually possessed by medical, law and technical schools forming a part of a university. It should be extended to other divisions when they become sufficiently large. Partly independent institutions for teaching or research can to advantage form part of a university. The separately endowed colleges of the English universities have certain advantages.

    In the department-store system, which is likely to prevail in our universities, the junior professors and instructors are responsible to the head of the department and are dependent on him for advances in office and salary, while the heads of departments are in like position in relation to the dean or the president, the heads of departments and deans being named by the president. The active committees are appointed by the president; in one of our leading universities even faculty members are named by the president from among the professors, making the faculty a presidential committee. This procedure reverses the proper or, at all events, the democratic method of control, according to which officers are chosen by those whom they serve and leaders are followed because they are acknowledged as such.

    The greatest possible care should be exercised in the selection of professors. Instructors and lecturers should be freely admitted to the university, but the professorship should be maintained as a high office. The alternative to permanence of tenure is competition for prizes under honorable conditions, but in this case salaries must be as large as the incomes of leaders in law, medicine and engineering. It is more economical and probably conduces to greater dignity and honor to pay adequate but moderate salaries with permanence of tenure, as in the army or the supreme court. Advances in salary should be automatic, as at Harvard, but there might to advantage be a few professorships with comparatively high salaries—the same as that of the presidency—vacancies in which would be filled by cooptation or by election by the faculties.

    Professors and other officers should not be distracted from their work of teaching and research by administrative politics. But they should select their administrative officers and legislative committees and have opportunity to make proposals and vote on questions of educational policy. Voting by mail and the fly-leaf method of discussion of the English universities could be adopted to advantage. An elected executive committee of the faculties meeting with the executive committee of the trustees is a feasible method of improving the existing academic situation.

    It should be noted that my correspondents were requested only to give an opinion of the proposed plan of university control. An answer expressing general agreement or disagreement was all that might be expected. It is, therefore, gratifying that so many discuss in detail the problems of academic administration. There is a natural temptation to attempt to answer the objections to the proposed plan, especially when it seems to have been misunderstood. Any brief statement is likely to appear dogmatic and bureaucratic, even though these may be the tendencies against which it is directed. I trust that the longer discussion here given may do away with any impression that the present writer has a ready-made scheme of university control or believes that all universities should be administered in the same way.

    Eighteen of the replies are from men who formerly held academic positions but are now connected with research institutions, the government service, etc., or who while holding professorships are principally engaged in other work. These replies show about the same distribution as the others, three in the first group, four in the second and eleven in the third. They are classed under the institutions with which the men are or were connected. Two replies from those previously connected with universities as teachers, but somewhat incidentally, have been omitted. They both belong to the third group.

    Similarly the late E. Benjamin Andrews, then president of the University of Nebraska, concluded an article on "University Administration" (Ed. Rev., March, 1906) with the words:

    <blockquote class="quotation">It is not thought that a professor who has grown inefficient has a right to his place simply because he has wrought long for the institution, even if his service has been satisfactory. ... In some cases application of the competitive system appears cruel, and it may now and then be so in fact; but none who compare institutions where this procedure prevails with those using greater apparent clemency can doubt which is the juster practise on the whole and in the long run.</blockquote>

    Several of the most distinguished university presidents have, however, defended permanence of tenure. Thus the late President Harper said in one of his quarterly statements (1901):

    <blockquote class="quotation">If an officer on permanent appointment abuses his privilege as a professor, the university must suffer and it is proper that it should suffer. This is only the direct and inevitable consequence of the lack of foresight and wisdom involved in the original appointment. The injury thus accruing to the university is moreover far less serious than would follow if, for an expression of opinion differing from a majority of the faculty or from that of the board of trustees or from that of the president of the university, a permanent officer might be asked to present his resignation. The greatest single element necessary for the cultivation of the academic spirit is the feeling of security from interference. It is only those who have this feeling that are able to do work which in the highest sense will be beneficial to humanity.</blockquote>

    President Eliot in his book on "University Administration" writes:

    <blockquote class="quotation">The statute which defines the tenures of office throughout the university is of fundamental importance; for it is practically the expression of a contract between the university and its teachers and administrators. This contract ought to provide for life-tenures after adequate periods of probation.</blockquote>

<a class="endnote_reference" href="bodymatter_part01_chapter04.html#p01_c04_note02" title="Note Reference 2">2 </a> The question of pensions and the complications which have arisen through the establishment and conduct of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching have been discussed by me in various articles. I venture to quote from one of them (Science, April 2, 1909):</p>

      <blockquote class="quotation"> Permanent tenure of office doubtless implies a continuation of salary or a pension in case the professor can no longer serve to advantage; and this leaves the difficulty resulting from paying a professor less than he is worth in middle life in order that he may receive more than he is worth in old age. Obviously we must face this situation; but it is emphasized and made worse by the establishment of a uniform and centralized system of pensions. It can be most conveniently met if we are sufficiently optimistic to assume that on the average the services of professors over sixty-five years of age are worth to their institutions and to the community the salaries that had previously been paid. A professor at this age may become a less efficient teacher in professional and required courses, though this is not always the case. It is, however, by no means certain that he is, on the average, a less desirable teacher in advanced and elective courses; or that his scholarship, experience, judgment and poise are not of the utmost advantage to the university. A man of this age may not have new ideas; but his research work and productive scholarship are likely to continue and to be of greater value to the world than the salary he is paid.</blockquote>

      <blockquote class="quotation">The institutions accepting the terms of the Carnegie Foundation for pensions on the basis of age must make retirement on a pension at sixty-five mandatory, or else they must make it a matter of arrangement between the administration and the professor. Either alternative is unfortunate. If the retirement is mandatory, the institution will lose men whom it can not afford to lose, and professors will be retired who are competent and anxious to continue their work. It will be a poor reward in the academic career to cut men off from the service of their lives and pay them part salary, when in other professions at that age they would probably have continued to be leaders and to have had an income at least twice as large as twenty years before. If the retirement is only permissory an institution might gain temporarily by retiring its less efficient men; but this would be only a mitigated form of the policy of dismissing professors whenever their places can be filled at less cost. Every institution could improve for a time its faculties by dismissing twenty per cent. of its professors; but such an undertaking would in the end be disastrous to the institution and to higher education. If only incompetent professors and those not in favor with the administration are retired at sixty-five, the pension will be far from an honor and by no means a worthy close to an academic career. It will frighten able men from it at the outset, and tempt them to desert it when they can.</blockquote>

      <blockquote class="quotation">It may give a sense of security to be assured of a pension in old age; but when the time comes the reduced salary will cause difficulty to those not having independent means. There will be a tendency for the professor to engage in some form of money-making and to begin early in his career. An eminent man of science has written to me that since he had been retired on a Carnegie pension he could no longer contribute to a scientific journal, as he had to earn a living for his family by writing fiction. The community and the world are largely dependent on the university professor for the advancement of science and scholarship and for the maintenance of the best ideals, and those great services are not paid for directly. They can only be assured by attracting the best men to university chairs and then setting them free to do their work with no interference and no fear of dismissal even on half salary.</blockquote>

      <blockquote class="quotation">In my opinion the Carnegie Foundation would have been most wisely administered if it had agreed to give to every institution that had adopted or would adopt a half-salary pension after the age of sixty or sixty-five an endowment sufficient to defray the remaining half of the salary, so that the professor would be paid his regular salary for life. He could then retire from the teaching for which he was not fit, but could continue to give his services to his institution and to his science. Or if the allowance had been paid by the foundation directly to the professor without regard to whether or not he continued his teaching, then he could give to his institution so much service as he might render to advantage and in turn receive so much salary as he might earn.</blockquote>

      <blockquote class="quotation">The drawbacks of a centralized pension system may be illustrated by an example. A professor has reached the age limit with a salary of $4,000. He prefers to continue his regular teaching and research and can do so competently. If the institution had to continue his salary, it would have no inclination to relieve him of his duties, nor would it care to do so if it had to pay a pension of $2,400, for in this case the $1,600 released would not suffice for the salary of a new professor. But if the payment of the professor's pension can be put off on the Carnegie Foundation, then the president will reflect that he can obtain a new man about equally competent for $3,000. He will thus save $1,000, and the institution will still have credit for the work of the retired professor; the students he attracts; the indirect teaching that a man engaged in research at the university can not fail to do; his valuable judgment and counsel. The institution saves $1,000 and gets $2,400 more that it could not get in any other way. At first sight it may seem that no one suffers except the dismissed professor; but in the end it will be found that the institution and higher education also suffer. ... In order to reward a professor after long years of service, he should be relieved, not of half of his salary and the privilege of teaching, but of so much routine instruction and administration as interfere with his research. This is now done in our better universities; professors of distinction who wish to devote themselves mainly to advanced students and research work are encouraged to do so.</blockquote>

    A considerable number of my correspondents argue against the statement in the memorandum sent them to the effect that the salary and the dignity of the presidential office should not be greater than those of the professorship. It was not, of course, intended to imply that all professors should have the same salary as the president, but only that those professors in the university whose work is of equal value to society should receive equal rewards. When the expenses of the president for clerical assistance, traveling and official entertainment are larger than those of the professor they should be defrayed by the university, as should the greater expenses of the professor for books and apparatus. It may be that under the existing system the president should have a larger salary to cover the greater risks of the trade, but the proper solution is to permit an easy return to the professorship. I do not admit that executive ability is rarer than ability in teaching and research, or that the competitive system is more desirable for the presidency than for the professorship. The buyer for a dry-goods firm may receive a larger salary than the governor of the state of New York, a United States senator or the chief justice of the United States. We do not get better university presidents by paying salaries as large as the dry-goods buyer receives; the result is a demoralization of the academic situation.

    This discussion is concerned with problems of administration, not with questions of teaching and research. The latter are by far the more important; indeed, administrative methods are only of consequence in so far as they affect education within and without the university, research and the applications of knowledge. Incidentally I may remark that I should give the student the same freedom and the same democratic system that I should like to see the teacher enjoy. I should admit to the university any student and let him stay there so long as his presence did not do injury to others. I should let him choose his own work and his own methods of work, not because all kinds and methods of work are equally good, but because I regard myself as incompetent and most of my colleagues as even more incompetent to impose any system on the student. I should in large measure do away with grades, required attendance, required courses, required examinations and degrees, not because these things are not in some ways and in some cases useful, but because on the whole they do more damage than good. So far as possible, I should let students manage their own affairs, their dormitories, fraternities and athletics, their codes of manners and of morals.

    This is illustrated just now by the conflict between the British Medical Association and the British government. It may seem to be of greater advantage to physicians than to the people that the government has been forced to increase the fees which it proposed to provide; but in the end the rewards and the control which physicians have obtained through their organization will be of advantage to the nation.

    The data and argument of this presentation in part overlap the scope of two addresses to educational assemblies. The first was delivered at the Trustees' Conference held in connection with the inauguration of President James at the University of Illinois (October, 1905), and was published in the proceedings reporting the exercises of that occasion, and also in Science, April 13, 1906.

The time seems appropriate for a more general survey in which the perspective of importance of the several issues may appear in their true values, admittedly as interpreted by my own color-scheme.

    The danger of externalism—the theme of the present discourse—to the public school system is looked upon by Mr. J. P. Munroe ("New Demands in Education, 1912") as a potent factor in the comprehensively unsatisfactory character of our educational system, methods and product. He regards the limitation of authority of school boards and the establishment of school faculties with authority over educational matters as essential steps to permanent improvement. The present system wastes the intellectual force and enthusiasm of good teachers; it deadens initiative and cultivates prudent acquiescence. In its place a true professionalism would advance the status of teaching and teachers more effectively than any other single measure, and would bring with it the benefits now sought for in vain by petition and complaint.

    It is worth footnoting that the Carnegie Foundation which is ostensibly devoted "to the Advancement of Teaching" (yet is governed by a board of college presidents with no representative of the teaching profession) sponsored a report on efficiency in academic affairs, which brought forth the following comment from a journal technically expert to judge the article: "Its whole tenor was to lay emphasis upon the destruction of the academic freedom and initiative that is necessary to the advancement of human intelligence, and to promote that kind of organization which under the guise of uniformity and system effectively suppresses progress" (<i>Electrical World and Engineer</i>). And this from a worldly source: "What efficiency experts sometimes forget is that there is a type of ability that can be found and retained better by the offer of a secure and dignified post than by the flourishing of money" (<i>Springfield Republican:</i> editorial). An efficiency primer might well set forth as its first axiom, that it consists in adapting means to ends; its second, that different ends require different means; its third, that expertness in means grows out of loyalty to ends. Beyond this, matters are too complex for those who use primers—even for the intelligent and benevolent laity of mature years.

    The appeal to experience is curiously partial. If the larger experience of the old world be considered, the burden of proof falls the other way. Externalism does not obtain there in the same manner or temper; presidential autocracy has not been found necessary or desirable; faculty control exists in variable yet always satisfactory measure; and the evils that flourish in American institutions are minimized. It has not been shown that our educational requirements are so wholly peculiar as to demand opposite provisions; it is fairly established that the democratic traditions of the old world are responsible for some of the mitigations and concessions which have prevented the system of imposed authority from developing its direst possibilities.

    I give as an instance an issue which, if not of acute importance is so rated in many a quarter, and which is sufficiently generic that it might have occurred in any one of a dozen institutions. The decision to build a large stadium for athletic contests was reached without consulting the faculty, who, it was assumed, if indeed they were considered at all, would delightedly approve of this expenditure of funds even though other cherished purposes would thereby be deferred,—a common occurrence. The vital decision in this expenditure is an academic one. Whether such a structure is needed depends upon the place to be assigned to athletics in the educational scheme. If you have the stadium you must have the crowds to fill it, and provide the occasions by exhibiting the brawn of studious manhood in the arena. To vote for the stadium is to decide an educational issue, and to commit the faculty to a policy for the complications of which they will in the future be held to account. It seems so elementary a fact that the spending of money for educational purposes is an educational matter, that only the narrowly practical man of business (and presidents with interested motives) would undertake to put asunder what the nature of the interests to be protected has joined together. I am tempted to add the comment of a man of business associated with the financial side of a large university to the effect that the trustees of private institutions had considerable business in investing funds and getting them, and thus were profitably occupied; but that there was so little of this to be done by the regents of state institutions that about all the latter could do was to direct affairs largely out of their province.

    It is clear that I am not reviewing the salary question, but am touching only on one phase of the principles affecting its solution. The question was discussed five years ago by an association, composed of the presidents and deans of a score of the foremost universities, which is sufficiently naïve or presuming to call itself "The Association of American Universities." Only one protagonist stood out against his associates for an uncompromisingly academic adjustment. Let me record my optimism in my belief that he would not stand alone to-day. I am not in the least unaware of the many difficulties that beset the practical adjustment of salaries to condition; nor do I forget that at some stage a modus vivendi between academic and economic demands must be arranged. This does not in the least excuse the reply of a president to a plea for the academic adjustment: "I have never been able to manage a university" (note the language) on that plan. That statement is a confession of unfitness. It would be invidious to point out how this or that institution has admirably solved one or another phase of the problem. There is sufficient proof that a reasonable solution can be reached even under present conditions. I also offer the two-edged philosophic consolation that since salary can not possibly reflect merit, it does a man no good and no harm to receive more or less of it than do his colleagues. Perhaps this truth should be kept for home consumption; to offer it to the public may lead to complications.

    Since writing these words Mr. Owen Johnston has set forth in no uncertain temper the "Shame of the Colleges" in terms of undergraduate dissipation, not as ominous in its physical extravagance as in its intellectual waste. It is the undergraduate distortion of perspective that is the source of despair, and for which the academic authorities must accept a considerable responsibility.

    Since this article was written, Professor Cattell has made known the results of his inquiry in regard to the opinions of professors upon the desirability and acceptability of the present system of academic control. (See <i>Science</i>, May 24 and 31, 1912.) Speaking generally, the inquiry, which was conducted upon a wide basis and presumably a frank one, reveals the astonishing conclusion that 85 per cent, of the replies are unfavorable to the system in vogue—the system here criticized. It is even more significant that a large majority advocate a very decided and radical reconstruction to bring about an urgently needed reform. The variety of points of view from which the dominant system is attacked is also suggestive. Knowing as I did, from the many letters of endorsement of my own utterances, that there was a wide-spread sympathy with this position, I was yet entirely unprepared to find so general an expression of dissatisfaction. It would appear that the professors constitute a fairly unanimous army of insurgents, with a peculiar reticence in announcing their cause, and a reluctance to enlist in any active operations. None the less the statistical result is a cause for congratulation; and the academic world owes a debt to Professor Cattell the nature of which the future will more clearly reveal. Of the several constructive suggestions those advanced by Professor Cattell must now be accorded the preferred position, since it is with reference to them that a representative referendum of the academic profession has been taken. When it is realized that a considerable majority favors an extensive reconstruction of the system as established, and that the professors as a body find themselves dispirited and not inspired by the provisions supposed to ensure their efficiency, it is hardly probable that boards of management will fail to respond to this convincing and notable evidence that there is something out of joint in the academic situation. In my opinion Professor Cattell has indicated a workable, flexible program. As a platform its stability will depend not so directly upon this or that plank which is inserted or omitted or trimmed to local requirements, as upon its finding a solid support in the sentiments and judgments of those whose business and privilege it will be to direct its construction as at once a visible and a spiritual reality.
