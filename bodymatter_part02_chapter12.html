    <h2 class="calibre9">XII. Letters from Institutions in the Southern States</h2>

    <p>Taking the suggestions up one by one, I would say under the first heading that in the case of state universities it is very unlikely that any state would consent to give up the direct control of the institution which it supports, nor do I think that the state should give up such control. This means the election of the majority, at least, of trustees directly by the representatives of the people. Secondly, I see no possibility whatever of dividing the duties of the president between one who shall represent the university in its outer relations and one who shall take care of all of its internal affairs. The first one would be a mere figurehead and could easily be dispensed with, or, if he were a strong man and declined to be set aside, there would be increasing conflict and trouble. Again, as to the president who is to be elected by the professors or their representatives, my experience of more than thirty years would make me think that the mode of election is unwise, and I am quite sure that no one who has a satisfactory position as a professor would consent to take the office of the so-called "president" under the conditions mentioned. The only possible reasons for a professor's laying down the work of teacher and taking up that of an executive are that there must be greater dignity or greater power for service or greater salary attached. One or all of these motives must move him; otherwise the sacrifice is too great. Thirdly, as to the divisions of the university, I think that any large organization naturally falls into such divisions. The mode of appointment or electing the heads of the divisions suggested by you might prove under some circumstances a wise mode, but either the election of these officers by their colleagues or the appointment by the executive can lead to great and serious abuse. Neither method is perfect.</p>

    <p>I do not believe that you, or any one else for that matter, have reached a remedy for the situation which has gradually <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page189" title="189"></span>arisen in the American university. In our democratic form of government we have a condition of things which is just as intolerable. Our city governments are controlled in the greater number of instances by ignorant and corrupt political bosses; our states by political machines which in no wise represent the will of the people; and, in my opinion, the president of the United States has become, within his own party at least, as veritable a tyrant as any monarch of whom we read in history, except, of course, as concerns the power over the life and death of the citizen. We are a tax-ridden people, and I have no doubt that we pay considerably more for the necessities of life than any civilized people on the globe. It seems to me therefore that if democracy has failed in the affairs of the nation it is just as apt to fail in the life of the university, and in those few instances in which the president of the university has been elected from and by the faculty I fail to see that it has contributed anything of material importance to the development of the university, while it may have contributed to the general peace of mind of individual members of the faculty. In order to have unity and order and gradual development in our university life, we have to have a head or heads of things to whom we can look for the formulation and proper carrying out of such plans as will contribute to progress and unity and order within the university. Now the unfortunate element in the situation is that just as soon as this head or these heads are appointed they at once begin to arrogate to themselves authority and privileges which originally were never intended, and there is no one to say them nay. In the American universities it is not always the president that makes for autocracy—sometimes it is an inordinately ambitious dean, or a head professor who feels called upon to play to the grandstand. As I see it, one of the great evils of the situation is that we have delegated to the president of the university entirely too much authority, and we have come to expect of him entirely too much. We expect the president of the university to raise funds for the university, and naturally he feels that he alone should control their expenditure. He practically appoints the faculty, and naturally he insists upon the unqualified support by individual members thereof, and he has become intolerant of faculty <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page190" title="190"></span>criticism even to the remotest degree. He is often the sole representative of the university upon public occasions and he has become practically the sole recipient of university honors. In other words, he has tended to magnify and exalt what is called executive ability far above scholarly attainment and productive scholarship. The measure of a man's usefulness in the world, even in the scholastic walks of life, has come to be measured by the number of his women stenographers and by the bulk of his mail. In all these relations we have tended to make of the president of the American university a sort of great "I am," and it can scarcely be wondered at that in the course of time he comes to share the same opinion. I have come to think, therefore, that it might be well to make a division of the duties that have gradually fallen to the lot of the president of the American university. Put the getting of money and gifts in the hands of one man. Put all matters pertaining to expenditures in the hands of a good business man. Put the appointment of professors and instructors in the hands of the university senate, composed of all the professors. Put the matter of student attendance in the hands of the registrar and the heads of departments, and put the administration of the internal affairs of the university in the hands of an administrative council consisting of the president and the deans of the university. In other words, what I think should be aimed at is a distribution of authority and in all matters of university policy and administration a consensus of the opinion of many open and independent minds. This is certainly not the case at present, nor will it become so by any mere variation in the mode of securing the appointment or election of president.</p>

    <p>I believe that I am in sympathy with the general trend of the opinions expressed in your paper on university control. May I take up seriatim what seem to me some of the most important points? (1) Method of appointing trustees. You propose a corporation to elect trustees. I incline to believe that a corporation composed of alumni should indirectly elect a percentage of the trustees. The remaining and greater part of the body should in my opinion be self-perpetuating or (in tax-supported institu-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page191" title="191"></span>tions) be elected indirectly by the people. What is needed is a stable board, the members of which recognize the responsibility and honor of the position and remain open to influences of a non-personal nature. (2) Powers of the trustees. Your scheme leaves the trustees with so little power that proper men would scarcely care for the office. The election of faculty members and the creation of new chairs or unit-departments together with the drawing up of the budget of expense should, I think, still remain in the hands of the trustees—who in a general way play the part of the national government in the affairs of the German universities. (3) Your idea of the division of the university into unit-departments is something I approve of. The financial autonomy which you propose I scarcely think desirable. (4) Nomination and election of professors. Your plan for the nomination of professors by the unit-department is good. I do not think your advisory board is necessary. The university senate should pass upon the nominations, selecting two or three, and recommend them in order of preference to the trustees. (5) University senate. I agree with you that such a body is most desirable. Probably the members would best be elected by the unit-departments as you suggest. At any rate, each unit-department should be represented and the representatives should not be appointed by the president. Such a body would make all the important recommendations to the trustees, such as the creation of chairs or unit-departments with statements of the expense involved. Minority reports should be regarded as proper. It should be understood that the qualifications which fit a man for the routine duties of a deanship do not of necessity fit him for a seat in the senate. (6) President. I think with you in some points regarding this office. The faculty should participate in filling the office, possibly making nominations to be passed upon by the senate, the final election being by the trustees. The office should, I think, be better paid than the best professorship. The president should be the presiding officer of the senate, and his opinion or vote should carry extra weight. He should be the sort of man capable of carrying on the routine executive duties well, and one who would help to maintain in the university senate an interest and enthusiasm for the whole university leading to cooperative effort. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page192" title="192"></span>Where the university can afford to provide for ex-presidents, it would probably be well to make the appointment for a limited period, as you suggest, say for ten years. This would be a further factor, acting along with the influence of the senate, toward building up and steadily maintaining a set of guiding traditions on the importance of which you justly lay weight. At present the change in the office of president is too much of a crisis in the life of the university. (7) I agree with you that professorships should be life appointments with a possibility of removal after trial before the trustees; that the pay should be fixed with an automatic increment for all offices. Appointments below the professorship might well be made for a period. There should be no automatic promotion. (8) You make the point that the introduction of business by members of the faculty should be better provided for than it is at present. I think that you here touch upon a weak spot in American institutions. Members of the faculty, whether or not members of the senate, should be encouraged to introduce propositions to that body, through the president or otherwise.</p>

    <p>Here I see enough of the evils of autocracy. I doubt very much if it would be possible to create a body like the "senate" of an English university consisting of all alumni who are willing to pay a small annual fee to "keep their names on the books." This you seem to have in mind in your first paragraph and note. Like many institutions in the old countries, founded on immemorial custom, it seems to work fairly well, but probably would not bear transplanting.</p>

    <p>It is much better than the present prevailing plan. The proposal to make it work out by gradual evolution is especially good. I do not know how the ultimate committees, those of the senate and of the trustees, would work together, but however much they might disagree, the teaching body would be heard in public. I think, however, that your efforts will be in vain, as the forces now in control are too strongly entrenched.</p>

    <p>(1) I like the democratic feature of the plan. The present method is extremely autocratic and not suited to a modern intel-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page193" title="193"></span>ligent democracy. (2) This is certainly a radical measure. You will be accused of having no "historical sense" or some such failing; of grafting a foreign system on an American institution. I have always been heartily in favor of your proposal; a poor hard-working scholar would be spared many a humiliation. It was the head of one of our greatest technical institutions (founded by the munificence of a steel-ribbed financial Goliath) who remarked to me: "Well, I hear that you do research work in mathematics; of course, we don't object to it," etc.—clearly hinting that they would connive at and ignore my bad habit in case I should become a member of his faculty, which I did not. (3) and (4) The "impeachment after trial" feature seems to me unnecessary and even harmful, when we take into consideration the wide-spread love of sensationalism in our country (<i>e. g.</i>, our heresy-trials). The same body that elects might also be relied on to remove undesirable members by the force of such public opinion as will find its expression within the faculty. However, this is a minor point. I would suggest that a vacant position ought to be advertised in one or more professional periodicals. (9—footnote) Very good! Here the men who do so-called administrative work get the promotions in the way of salaries— they are the "prominent" men. If you do research work as well as teach you are looked upon as a curiosity; they don't quite know where to place you.</p>

    <p>To the underlying principle, and to certain of the details, I heartily assent. If the two institutions with which I have been associated during the past fifteen years represent the general condition of affairs in the United States, we certainly need some method of organization which will bring some dignity to the office of professor and of the university teacher of lower rank.</p>

    <p>While I do not agree absolutely with all the details—probably no two men would so completely agree, and some of your suggestions are alternative in form—the main ideas put forward seem to me excellent. I think one or two little additions or amplifications might be made with possible advantage. Especially is it desirable, I think, that in any system of government <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page194" title="194"></span>there should be at every point well-fixed responsibility, admitting of no juggling or evasion. One of the worst evils of the presidential plan is often to be found in the president's nominally submitting to a faculty for discussion or vote a policy or proposed change of method when in reality the faculty contains so many of the younger men—assistant professors or even full professors—who have been appointed in name or in fact by the president, that they enquire only as to what he favors and vote blindly for that, though the result is given out as independent endorsement of the scheme in question.</p>

    <p>I believe that I approve heartily of all that you say except as to paragraph 2. Perhaps I confuse the duties of chancellor and of president. But I take it that the time of the president will be largely taken up with the larger affairs of administration. Presumably he is a highly educated man—particularly interested in some one line. He is called upon to sacrifice his private interest in his work and to some extent his hope of advancement and reputation in his chosen line. I think the office might therefore be regarded as one of particular honor and deserving of increased pay. I do not see why giving either should affect adversely any desirable relation between the president and the faculty. If the president is elected to serve but one year increased pay might not be so necessary, but I think there would be some sacrifices in the efficiency of the office. I very much wish that you would enlarge the scheme so as to lay down certain general principles that could safely serve as a guide to other and smaller institutions. Such general principles might include such of the following as survived critical examination. (1) The number of trustees should be so limited that each might feel a large and distinct share of personal responsibility for the conduct of the institution (82, as at the University of North Carolina, is manifestly too large a body). (2) Some of the trustees should be elected by recent graduates from among their number. (Thus in a body of 15 trustees, each class upon graduation might elect one trustee to serve for three years. Perhaps a fourth could be elected for one year by alumni 3 to 6 years out of college.) The idea is to keep the trustees closely in touch with the students' points of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page195" title="195"></span>view of the institution, its professors, and its policies—a point of view that I believe is always worth knowing and very often worth heeding. If the recent graduates did not measure up to the responsibility thus placed upon them—that fact alone should prove a useful hint that the institution is failing to train students properly for the affairs of life. (3) A pretty clearly defined distinction should be drawn between the temporary and the permanent part of the teaching force. The minimum salary given to any permanent member of the teaching force has a great influence in determining the spirit of the institution, and this minimum salary should always be sufficient to enable a man and his family to live in accordance with the demands of the situation. Assistants, instructors and others in the "trying out" period should not be encouraged to remain indefinitely in these positions. If it is not possible that these men, when they have proved themselves worthy, can become a permanent part of the institution at a livable salary for themselves and family they should be encouraged to leave. (4) Every member of the permanent part of the teaching force should have a share in determining the general policy of the institution and should feel to some extent responsible for the spirit and policy of the institution. Important changes in policy should be passed upon by both faculty and trustees. (5) The president should carry out the policy of the institution as determined by faculty and trustees. He should not be regarded as, and should never become, the sole go-between between the faculty and trustees. This function should be performed by committees subject to the control of the respective bodies. (6) All important university committees should be elected by the faculty or by the representatives of the various faculties. (7) In nominations and promotions for permanent positions the following are interested parties: First, all the permanent force of the department concerned. Second, the closely related departments. Third, the university faculty as a whole. Fourth, the president. Fifth, the trustees. The actual power of nomination and promotion should be in the hands of a committee suitably representing the interested parties, their action to be subject to review by the board of trustees. In electing a president the university faculty and the board of trustees are the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page196" title="196"></span>interested parties. (8) Changes in salary should be automatic, so far as possible, but some provision should be made allowing occasional exceptions to be made. There is nothing new in any of the above suggestions and doubtless they are somewhat crude and are certainly incomplete. But I believe some careful outline of the principles which should underlie a democratic university control would be helpful.</p>

    <p>I agree with you as to the general policy suggested in your letter. The subject is a most difficult one and many-sided. At one time, when every detail of the administration was in the hands of the faculty as a whole, we were constantly inconsistent, passing laws at one meeting and repealing or changing them at another, so that I felt convinced that the whole management should be in the hands of one man, viz., the president, assuming of course that he would be an ideal head and that the advice of members of the faculty, especially on all the points concerning each department, would be constantly sought by him. But you know an ideal man is a <i>rara avis</i>, and I have modified my views very materially. For a small institution like ours, I think the president should be at the head, but I think it would be a wise thing to have provision made for the members of the faculty having a voice in all matters concerning election of professors and instructors, and most particularly as regards each man having equal vote with the president concerning instructors and all changes in his own department. Of course, with an ideal president all that would go without saying. Then again I have seen how an occasion might arise when the faculty, as distinguished from the president, should have a legitimate way of presenting their views on any question directly to the trustees. This would, of course, be possible even with an autocratic president, provided the members of the faculty could be induced to take any position, seemingly, even, antagonistic to the president. But you know how that is, where members of the faculty are at the mercy of the president.</p>

    <p>The following, in my opinion, are the great needs of the university: (1) Academic freedom. (2) The segregation of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page197" title="197"></span>financial work of the university from its academic work. (3) An academic senate, which will have complete control of the academic work and in which every member of the university, including its students, could have a voice. The votes in the academic senate should be graded. Say a full professor would have five votes, an assistant professor three votes, the lecturer two votes and the instructor one vote. The student senate should be a separate house and to this lower body should be delegated all matters connected with the discipline, subject to the veto or modification of the academic senate. The chancellor, or president, of the university should be an honorary officer and he should be chosen annually. The students should not so much go to universities, as they should go to Professor A, or Professor B. When I am asked where I studied in Germany I do not reply at the University of Berlin, but I say I studied with Hoffman, Helmholtz, Virchow. (4) The university should be free from the influence of endowments, money or greed. This is accomplished by the separation of the financial from the academic functions. The financial authorities should grant every year an annual budget and the academic authorities should distribute this grant, fixing the salaries of every one of the teaching force, these salaries being subject to annual fluctuations. With state institutions, the financial matters, of course, would rest with the state, as they do at the present time, but the state should not interfere with academic functions. Above all the university should be free from the scandals of the last few years which have presented dozens of spectacles of their professors defending flagrant violators of the law in the criminal courts and supporting under oath offenses against good morals and the peace and dignity of the country. (5) The autocracy and tyranny of the present system of ruling universities is contrary to every principle of academic freedom and sense of right and justice. I can not go into detail in regard to matters of administration, but I think I have given you pretty fully the basis of my own conception.</p>

    <p>The evil of presidential autocracy is naturally most conspicuous in large institutions, like Columbia, where homogeneity is impossible, and where personal acquaintance among the different <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page198" title="198"></span>members of the teaching corps is much restricted. Even in small institutions like that with which I am connected, having about 600 students, it becomes natural for the president to develop into a political boss, regarding athletics as of more practical importance than science or literature, taking pride almost exclusively in numerical growth, and caring nothing for scholastic standards. No single plan of reform can be generally applied, but each separate institution has to grapple with its local problems, without help from outside. Your plan of university control, as soon as I read it in 1906, had my hearty sympathy, so far as its aims are concerned; but some of its features I do not expect ever to see carried out, whatever may be the developments after the natural close of my life. As to their advisability, except in relation to colleges rather than great universities, I am unable to offer any opinion, because my experience has been limited to small institutions in which research has held only a subordinate place and good teaching has been of prime importance. What I write therefore has to be taken with due recognition of my lack of direct familiarity with the evils that have grown up in the great universities. (1) I should not favor the formation of a corporation consisting of the professors, alumni and members of the community. The inevitable result, it seems to me, would be an increase of political manipulation and intrigue. The alumni most anxious to secure election into such a body would be those who as students were most distinguished for their "college spirit." This means that the baleful influence of athletics would be intensified by the activity of its representatives in the governing body. The larger this body is the greater is the danger of the delegation of control to a small clique. Effective control requires thorough organization, frequent meetings and full attendance. Each individual member of the body has to feel that he has something personally at stake, instead of donating his time and energies to an institution in which his interest is platonic. The faculty members are the men whose interest is most direct; and a group of faculty members, picked out on account of their proved efficiency in administrative affairs, ought to be joined with a local committee of the trustees to cooperate with the president at periodic meetings, with power to limit thus <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page199" title="199"></span>the opportunities for presidential autocracy. (2) The president should be elected by this joint committee of trustees and professors, the election being subject to confirmation by the full board of trustees. All of this committee should be admitted to the annual meetings, or special called meetings, of the full board. The president's salary should be larger than that of a professor, because his work, if he is fit for his position, is harder, and his responsibility includes a wider range. His term of office should be for a definite term of years, such as five or ten, but he should be eligible for reelection. In this reelection every full professor should have the right to vote. The German method of annually electing a rector was in force during three quarters of a century at the University of Virginia. A rector needs more than a year to become thoroughly efficient; hence by annual reelection the Virginia rector always served during a succession of years. But the plan was finally discarded a few years ago, as unsuitable for American conditions. There seems to be no probability that any American university can be induced to adopt such a plan again. It undoubtedly secured professorial freedom, but this advantage was considered to be more than offset by the absence of coordination. I do not see how reasonable discipline can be maintained on the German plan. During my own period of study in Germany I was greatly struck with the superfluity of triflers, of beer-drinking idlers, whose presence ought not to be tolerated. I believe in the imposition of frequent and rigid tests of scholarly attainment, and the prompt elimination of those who come for athletics and other "college activities." (3) With your third paragraph I am in entire agreement. (4) With your fourth paragraph I agree, except that I would object to financial autonomy for the separate departments. I think the finances should be managed at a single central office for the entire institution. (5) With your fifth paragraph I am in agreement.</p>

    <p>Your general plan I like, yet it appears to me to be too complicated. As our great corporate industries increase in size the machinery of their administration is so completely systematized that it really becomes simple. It is just this systematization that we need in our universities as they increase in size. Each de-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page200" title="200"></span>partment autonomous in itself and responsible only to the next higher unit. This ultimately comes up to the head and the policy of the institution and who shall appoint the former and determine the latter. Here, it seems to me, is the great difficulty. Another way of putting it is: Where shall the ultimate authority rest? That the present systems are for the most part faulty is clear enough. What we have had here is illustrative of what is the case on a larger scale in many other universities. Up to ten years ago everything was in the hands of trustees, most of whom knew nothing of the institution except what they could learn in the one or two days of their annual meeting, and at that time they determined all the policies, elected professors, etc. It is needless to say that they rarely did anything except to defer to the views of one man, here resident, who was in touch with everything, and who really "ran the institution." The president, except for a larger salary and no duties as a teacher, was in no way different from the rest of the faculty. With the election of the present president things changed, as the former autocrat had died, and there was no one to take his place. At least there was no one on the board who had the force and was willing to busy himself with university affairs. As a result the present head soon took the reins into his hands and from that time he has "run the institution," except when in a few matters of policy some of the faculty lobbied members of the board with sufficient force to compel the president to adopt their views as his policy to avoid a defeat. It is needless to say that such compulsion in no way promoted harmony. It was a weakness of the president that he could not delegate anything. As a result all that was done was done by him. This is very wearing on a president. Now wherever the organization permits the president to become an autocrat in my opinion he will become one. The temptation is too strong for a mortal to resist. This brings me to my first constructive point. The head should not be a man but a committee. This committee should be made up of the heads of the chief divisions of the institution, and should thus represent the different chief interests. In my judgment it should number not less than three nor more than five. (Similarly in each of these chief divisions the "head" should be a committee made <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page201" title="201"></span>up of the chairmen of the next lower committees.) This executive committee should assign the work and policy to the next lower committee and to them the lower committee should be responsible. The ultimate policy of the institution should be determined by a committee which should be made up of the executive committee above (or their representative or representatives), representatives of the board of trustees, and representatives of the alumni, no one of these three sets of representatives being in a majority. This ultimate committee should number between seven and eleven, nine being probably the best number, three from each class. Members of the teaching force should be selected and nominated by the committee of their class but elected by the next higher committee. Appeals from committee decisions should in general be carried only as far as the next higher committee. It seems to me that the plan suggested is on the lines which have proved most successful in great corporate enterprises, but it does away with the very real danger of autocracy, in that it substitutes a committee representing divergent interests, or rather sub-interests, for a single man.</p>
