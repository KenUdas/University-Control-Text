    <h2 class="calibre9">VIII. Letters from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</h2>

    <p>My first impression, after reading the paper through, was that some of your suggestions met with mental friction on my part. I certainly see no reason for making a president's salary the same as that of the professor. There are a hundred men who can be good professors to one who has the capacity for becoming what I would call a good president, and I can say this without criticizing in any way any president or any professor. I should say that good presidents were as rare in academic work as they are in the commercial industries, and I see no reason why they should not be paid in accordance with their abilities. This does not mean that I would wish to see all professors endowed with the abilities of a good president. A professor must be primarily a specialist in a more or less narrow field, because as man is yet constituted there are few of us capable of being exceedingly broad and exceedingly acute at the same time. The only people I would elect for life are murderers. I do not believe that the best can be got out of a system operated by men if that system is operated by means of the average opinion of the men. In other words, a democracy does not appeal to me where high quality is an aim. I should say, in general, pick the best man possible for any piece of work and supply him with assistants, which in this case would be the professors, to carry out and develop his plans. I think this is in keeping with most advance, which, when brought to final analysis, may usually be found to be an individual matter. Certainly in the matter of discovery and experimental work we find that committees can not invent, and responsibility divided is as good as shifted. I see no reason for drawing a line representing numbers or distinguishing between a college and a university, assuming that below this line a single president can well lead a college, but above it no one man can well lead a university. Possibly some university presidents are despots, but if this is the case, raising their salaries to $100,000 a year would<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page139" title="139"></span> be likely to reduce the despotism in time. My reason for saying this is that it would become fairly obvious what a good president ought to do and be, and this price might make it attractive to men whom I think would be capable of filling the position. You would have to excuse me from being a member of the teaching staff of an institution of learning where the petty jealousies which sometimes occur between the professors were the factors in determining their or my advancement. I may be hardhearted, but I believe in a system which requires every man to do his best and that all the time, and I hope I should be ready, as a professor, to drop my work or step back a peg or two, when some other man was capable of carrying it on better than I could. Your idea of having a unit group of men intimately connected with one particular subject appeals strongly to me, but even in that group there would have to be one man who was more or less the leader, as long as men are constituted as we are to-day.</p>

    <p>I do not think that any system of government will ever do away with the prime importance of executive control, both in the president and the deans. The best government in the world, to my thinking, is the benevolent despotism, run on a basis of efficiency which now controls the Panama Canal Zone. I do not agree that the trustees of an American university have absolute powers. They seem to me to be rather the servants of the alumni and the faculties, particularly if they are broad-minded business man of the modern type, capable of realizing their responsibilities as public servants, and serving without salary. They are much better fitted to control than an executive body chosen by salaried professors. I agree that the division unit of from ten to twenty men is a good one, and see no objection to separate endowments for divisions, provided these endowments are regulated and managed from a central office. I think that the division should be headed by a strong dean who should retain his headship for a considerable time and even for life, if his services are satisfactory, and who with other deans would represent the division on an executive committee, meeting with the executive committee of the trustees. I do not believe in President Eliot's Harvard system of appointing junior pro-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page140" title="140"></span>fessors as temporary chairmen of departments. Such a system effectually prevents a department from following a consistent policy. With regard to appointments, as for example the appointment of the deans, I do not see how we can, by any mere mechanism, avoid favoritism and injustice. I do not believe that any system the world has ever seen ever produced more favoritism and injustice than the so-called representative government of American municipalities. Everything depends on the men and their personalities, and so long as our universities continue to be charitable institutions, dependent on the contributions of wealthy patrons, they will have to be more or less dependent also on the whims of those patrons. I do not see how your representative system is ever going to finance a university.</p>

    <p>The proposed "corporation" seems to me too large and indefinite a body to exercise any other function than that of selecting representatives and supporting them by promoting public interest and generosity. The body of representatives thus elected it would seem to me more natural to call the corporation. The substitution of a chancellor, elected by the trustees, and a president, elected by the faculty, merely as "primus inter pares," seems to me to be attended with too much risk of sacrificing leadership. The European institutions, of which we naturally think in this connection, are not as a rule in a state of active organic development, nor under any obligation to appeal for continual public support. They have reached a state of comparative equilibrium as to finances, attendance and policy. If the functions referred to should be exercised here by a chancellor, the conditions would tend to become very similar to those which are now criticized. Within a division or department there should be a substantial nucleus of men of experience and long connection with the institution, but a majority of the entire group will often be inexperienced or not closely identified with the university. A completely democratic or even representative organization for such a group seems to me out of the question because it is so far from homogeneous or constant. If the group has educational and financial autonomy, the weak departments will grow weaker, the strong, stronger. The plan as a whole <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page141" title="141"></span>seems to me to be based too much on the theory that leadership is either not very important, or that it can be exercised by almost any man who is likely to be a member of the university faculty, or that it is certain to develop tyrannical tendencies. It seems to me, on the other hand, that the average university professor is likely to be of doubtful quality as a leader of men or even as a cooperator in any form of group activityâ€”being fundamentally an individualist. In my judgment, however, leadership of large groups is a rather unusual quality and a very important one to recognize and develop. Some of our serious difficulties in university control have been due to inefficiency in leadership and attempts to replace the real thing by inferior substitutes. To my mind the institution which can find a president who will really lead its faculty and other constituent bodies, encouraging initiative and respecting independence, is worthy of any honor or salary he is likely to receive, and in a minor degree I should say the same about a dean or head of a department (though I am perhaps not a competent witness on this latter point). What we need, in my judgment, is continued effort to educate trustees and the public up to this ideal of leadership with corresponding discrimination against false or inferior standards of efficiency, or the substitution of mere administration for leadership.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that your plan goes too far in imitating legislative methods without the control which public interest puts upon their deliberations. Nor do I think that the modes of thought of professors train them well for administrative functions. Witness the difficulty of finding among college faculties suitable presidents and deans. As between the horns of the dilemma you figure presidential autocracy as Scylla, and I must confess that I prefer the siren to the whirlpool. I notice, however, that the Odyssey describes both Scylla and Charybdis as devouring monsters each with six heads and twelve legs, so the choice between them is small.</p>

    <p>From a theoretical point of view the plan seems ideal, but I believe its practise impossible on account of lack of concentration of power in a supervising head, whether he be called chancellor <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page142" title="142"></span>or president. It seems to me particularly impractical for the technical school.</p>

    <p>It has always seemed to me that the system of administration of Harvard University was the best planned and most likely to be satisfactory in the long run of any that I know. It seems to me also that on the whole it has worked well in practise. I think that it would work still better if its visiting committees always contained a member of the board of overseers, as they frequently, perhaps usually, do, and if these committees devoted more time and thought to the purpose for which they are appointed. Certainly here we have found the kindly interest, appreciation and criticism from our own visiting committees (in this case always members of our corporation) of the greatest value. We had at one time, and for many years, a general visiting committee for the whole school from the alumni association. This did not accomplish what was hoped from it, however, since its members gave altogether too little time to the matter. A great value of our corporation visiting committee has lain in the fact that the whole working staff of each department has made acquaintance, and oftentimes a somewhat intimate acquaintance, with members of the corporation who were particularly interested in the work of the department. A few thoughts occur to me in relation to your numbered propositions, though these thoughts are hardly worthy of your consideration. (1) This proposition does not strike me very favorably as a whole. It seems to me that it might be too open to abuse from the inclusion of men who would get into the corporation to serve their personal interest rather than the interest of the university. If my understanding is correct, in the very early days of this institute the corporation was elected by the members of the Society of Arts; or at least this society, to which practically any one might belong, had a voice in the corporate management of the institute. The plan for obvious reasons worked badly and the institute shortly became a close corporation. This, however, is entirely inconclusive so far as the merits of your suggestion are concerned. If it could be assured that a chancellor would always be available who would be able and willing to devote himself heartily to the financial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page143" title="143"></span>interests of the university and its more public relations, leaving to the president the educational and scientific side, I should think such a plan would be an excellent one. But I fear such men would be too rare to serve the purpose. (2) This proposition would seem to imply an arrangement of the character which obtained for so many years in the University of Virginia. This always struck me as an admirable plan educationally, but it does not seem to have worked satisfactorily after the institution became larger and in need of increased endowment. (3) It seems to me that this proposition is unquestionably a correct one. It substantially agrees with our own departmental arrangements which I think as a whole have worked fairly well, and any defects in which are not incident to such a scheme as you suggest. (4) I should agree with this as a whole for each school. I question very much, however, whether, as at present constituted, it would work well to have the whole faculty nominate the professors. Perhaps with long experience conditions might make this feasible. It does seem to me that if the full professors or head professors or departmental heads could have information as to what nominations were proposed, with the privilege or duty of expressing their opinions, perhaps collectively, at least individually, this would be of value. I agree with your view that election to professorships should be for life, but I would limit these to full professorships and associate professorships. I think all other appointments should be for fixed terms. (5) These suggestions seem to me to be good, except that I think all financial and other extra-educational matters should be relegated to the board of trustees. Of course, the whole educational work of the university should be absolutely in the hands of its faculty.</p>

    <p>Harvard and Columbia, from what I hear, have suffered from autocratic and bureaucratic executive control. This was never the case at Yale, nor is it so at Technology. Indeed at Yale the president seemed to have very little power, and departments like that of mathematics were so completely in the hands of the few full professors of the subject that the department suffered, and with it the allied departments, through the lack of wisdom of these few men. On the whole, I believe that the professors in a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page144" title="144"></span>department are less qualified to build up that department than is the president; they are apt to be much narrower than he. This difficulty you have guarded against to a certain extent. I am inclined to think that organization by departments is perhaps not the best. There should be some crossing of the different departments. Thus to the mathematical department, and having a vote in its meetings, should be representatives of the allied departments of physics, chemistry, mechanics, engineering and so on, in sufficient number to prevent the mathematicians from refusing adequately to make provision for their needs. This would alleviate a possible bad condition of elannishness. Moreover, it might bring about an arrangement whereby members of one department actually gave instruction in another. There is no reason why a teacher of physics should not occasionally take a section of mathematics or mechanics, no reason why a teacher of mathematics should not take a section of mechanics or physics and so on. Such crossing of instruction is particularly desirable both for the students and for those teachers who have a good deal of routine work; for no teacher should be so narrow that he could not teach freshmen or sophomores in at least one subject other than his specialty. In general I should think that your scheme had much to recommend it. The idea of a chancellor is good. That the president should be merely the temporary (two years) chairman of his faculty seems also advisable. But really I have no very strong feelings, for the faculties on which I have been have always been pretty democratic.</p>

    <p>I believe there is need of improvement in the method of control of our educational institutions. So far as I feel qualified to judge I see much to commend in the plan you have proposed and little that I would criticize adversely. It seems of great importance to me that the policies of the institution should be determined by the professors, that is, by those most intimately acquainted with the educational problems; that the election of professors should be in the control of the faculty; but that the greatest possible safeguards should be exercised to prevent the entrance of incompetent or unfit members into the faculty. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page145" title="145"></span>Your plan of university control meets my approval most decidedly. It could not fail to prove a great advance over the existing autocratic system; and in my opinion its major features, at least, are sure to be adopted in this country. I wish that the founder or founders of our next university might see the wisdom of launching it as a republic instead of an autocracy.</p>

    <p>I am heartily in accord with practically all your recommendations. With the increasing demands upon the presidential office, I am convinced that it is more than one man can do and do it well. Possibly this could be obviated by releasing the president from all responsibility regarding the raising of funds for the institution. I am inclined to favor your idea of the chancellor and a president, but feel that the latter should <i>ex officio</i> be a member of the trustees. I thoroughly believe in the system you suggest in (4). I feel very strongly that the appointment and advancement of a person should not be dependent upon the will of any one man, particularly when that man is a person of whims and moods. I can point to several examples of retarded development, both to the persons concerned and the school with which they are associated, in consequence of this most unfortunate system. Where your plan has been adopted, I am informed that it has worked well.</p>
