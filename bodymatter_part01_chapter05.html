    <h2 class="UC_heading2">V. The Duties of The Professor</h2>

    <p>If it is not possible at present to have free professors and independent schools, we can at least strive for greater freedom of the individual and larger autonomy of the department within the university. As the position and salary of the professor should not depend on the favor of a president, so the department or school should be allowed substantial autonomy. There is nothing more disheartening to the members of a department or school than to have its activities prescribed or limited, its annual appropriation apportioned, by a centralized system. A great danger confronting the modern university is its own bulk. In the evolution of organic life a limit is placed on the size which an animal can attain. Its surface increases more slowly than its mass, and there must be differentiation and division of labor in order that the animal may grow and react properly to the environment. Even then a limit is fixed; it is doubtful whether apart from the nervous system a structure more complicated than that of the mammal will be reached, or that animals much larger than man will survive. Only a polyp or similar creature can conduct a pure democracy; the organization of higher animals must be more complicated. The growth in size of the American university has been large and rapid. Faculty or town-meeting methods have become difficult or impossible; the institution drifts into autocratic and bureaucratic control. A representative or delegated system of government is necessary for the university as a whole, but its divisions can maintain a family and democratic system.</p>

    <p>President Eliot says<a class="super_original" id="p01_c05_note01" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c05_note01">1</a> that a long tenure of office will <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page50" title="50"></span>be an advantage to the president and to the university he serves, but that the chairmen of departments should be chosen for short periods and should generally be junior or assistant professors to give them opportunity and because "dangers from the domination of masterful personages will be reduced to a minimum under this system." It is not evident why it is less desirable to limit "the domination of masterful personages" in the office of the president or of the dean than in the department. But it is true that a departmental autocracy may be even worse than one on a larger scale, and for the reason that it is conducted in the dark. A president may say that a teacher "ought not to be retained through fear of clamor or criticism," but fortunately public opinion does prevent the more serious abuses to which the system is liable. In certain departments of certain universities instructors and junior professors are placed in a situation to which no decent domestic servant would submit. Clearly that is no breeding ground for genius and great personalities.</p>

    <p>It can not be denied that the organization of the departments of a university is one of the difficult problems that confront us. The German plan, according to which the individual rather than the department is the unit, is in many ways preferable. But the American university conducts what is practically a secondary school in the first two years of the college, and it conducts professional schools which are not of university grade. The high schools and small colleges should take over the first two years of the college, establish schools of agriculture and of the mechanic arts, and conduct courses preparatory to medicine, law, engineering and teaching. In a large state, the state university would have one hundred thousand students, if it received all the young men and women between the ages of sixteen and twenty who <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page51" title="51"></span>should continue educational work. Such education should be provided locally and in connection with productive industry, as in the admirable plan adopted by the school of engineering of the University of Cincinnati, by which students work alternate weeks in the university and in the shop. Under President Eliot, Harvard placed both its college and its professional schools on a university basis; under President Lowell, it has moved backward in the direction of making the college a school of information and culture and of requiring the professional school to begin with the elements. To such an extent is the university the plaything of its president!</p>

    <p>For administrative and financial purposes it seems necessary to organize the university into schools, divisions or departments, although for educational purposes as much flexibility as possible should be maintained. The scope and size of such a division should depend on convenience and local conditions, rather than on logical distinctions among the subjects taught. A small college or a small medical school can be conducted to advantage under one faculty. In a large university there is no need to have a separate department for each of the oriental languages because they differ from one another more than do the European languages, though it may be desirable to have separate departments for German and French. When a medical school, or even the work in a special science, such as chemistry, becomes large, it may be advisable to organize it into partly autonomous divisions. There is no gain in economy and usually a loss in cooperation and effectiveness when the entering class of a college or professional school exceeds fifty or a hundred, and when its faculty exceeds twenty or thereabouts. Colleges should remain small; if a university must have a great crowd of college students, they should be divided among separate colleges, as in the English<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page52" title="52"></span> universities. These colleges should not, however, consist of freshmen, as President Lowell plans, or of students belonging to a certain social class, as is likely to happen under the fraternity and club system, but of men having common intellectual interests. Even small colleges for general education should aim to excel and to do research work in some special direction. In the large university the residential colleges and departments should coincide, so that younger men will join a group of older students and instructors having similar interests and ends in life. As I have elsewhere remarked:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation">The ideal is the zoological hall of the old Harvard, where apprentices of a great man and a great teacher lived together. This is told of again in the charming autobiography of Shaler. A boy from the aristocratic southern classes, with ample means and good abilities but no fixed interests, fell into this group. There he discovered his life-work and pursued it with boundless enthusiasm. Nor did the fact that he devoted himself exclusively to professional work in natural history in college prevent him from writing Elizabethan plays in his old age. The number of men of distinction given to the world from this small Agassiz group is truly remarkable.</blockquote>

    <p>A group of some 10 to 20 instructors, having registered primarily under them from 50 to 200 students, is a good size for a school, division or department. Each can be well acquainted with the others and take a personal and intelligent interest in all the work of the department. At the same time the number is sufficient to permit the representation of diverse kinds of work and points of view, and to make possible the election of officers and a democratic control. The chairman or head and an executive committee should of course be elected, not named by a semi-absentee president. In a group of this character questions are not usually brought to a vote. In reaching decisions each member is likely to be weighed as well as counted. In my experience the junior members of a faculty or department take too little rather than too much <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page53" title="53"></span>share in its discussions and its control. If they obtained constitutional rights they might become more aggressive; if they should, so much the better. One of the serious difficulties of the present system is that the younger men do not share in the conduct of the university and do not feel themselves to be part of its life. Those who do not have their ideas before they are thirty are not likely to have them. The paraphernalia and camp baggage of modern civilization have become so heavy that they threaten to block its further advance. If men must devote thirty years to mere acquisition, and be kept even longer in official subjection, there is not much chance that they will do anything else thereafter. What youth can do should be joined with what age can know.</p>

    <p>Voting rights in a department might be in proportion to the salary the officers receive; but such statutory regulations are scarcely needed. The real control is vested in the aggregate common sense of those concerned. The group may well be flexible in character. When courses of instruction and educational problems are under discussion assistants and even graduate students may be admitted to advantage. When the question is the promotion of an instructor, the group would naturally be limited to those of higher office. The chairmanship of the department might rotate among its members or the same head might be reelected continuously, according to convenience. It by no means follows that the professor most eminent in research should be the executive head; on the contrary, it should usually be a man of competent administrative ability whose time is of less value. Every reasonable man believes in economy in administration and letting the men do things who can do them. Even the most important decisions can be left to the head of the department or its executive committee, so long as they represent and are responsible to the whole department.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page54" title="54"></span>The school or department should have complete control of its own educational work. So long as there is ample room for differences of opinion as to the value of different subjects and methods, it is well that there be variation and survival of the fit. Entrance requirements and degrees are among the chief obstacles to education. An instructor in Columbia University said recently to a student who had just received the highest grade assigned in the course: "Why did you take the course, if you don't want a degree?" If there must be degrees, it may be necessary to standardize them; but this should be done only to the extent of prescribing the amount of work to be done in the direction called for by the degree, this being determined by the time spent, weighted in accordance with the ability of the students. I shall print shortly statistics in regard to all doctorates of philosophy granted in the sciences by American universities. For each department of each university will be given the percentage of doctors who continued to pursue scientific work and the percentage who attained a given degree of distinction. If any police regulation is needed, such publicity is far better than the examination of a candidate before the faculty, or the requirement of all sorts of qualifications.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c05_note02" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c05_note02">2</a></p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page55" title="55"></span>Financial as well as educational autonomy should be given to the school or department. Its total income should be held as a trust fund, to be decreased only after full and public investigation. The laboratories, rooms, apparatus, equipment, library, etc., should be held in trust for the department, to be taken away against its will only for clear reasons and on the recommendation of a competent faculty committee. Under these conditions the members of a department will plan on a safe basis for the future, and will seek to increase its funds and facilities. I know of a case in which a professor obtained a gift of $100,000, made expressly "to increase the facilities of the department," and the income was assigned by the president and trustees to pay the salary of that professor against his earnest protest. I also know of a case in which a department which had built up one of the strongest laboratories in the country had those of its rooms especially devoted to research taken away and given to a weak department, to induce a certain professor to accept a call from elsewhere to the headship of the weak department. These are of course extreme cases and might seem incredible, if it were not that interference with the vested rights of departments is of frequent occurrence.</p>

    <p>The Harvard plan of visiting committees which may take an active interest in the educational work and financial support of departments is commendable. Under the existing trustee system it might be well if one trustee would concern himself especially with one or two departments, attending their meetings and doing what he could to advance their interests. There can to advantage be within the university departments related to its educational work, but under independent control. Thus <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page56" title="56"></span>the most useful and vigorous division of Columbia University, with the possible exception of the faculty of political science, is the Teachers College, which is under its own trustees with a dean and faculty responsible to them. As a department of education under the trustees of Columbia College it would probably have had no more leadership than the departments at Harvard or Yale. The educational alliance between Columbia University and the Union Theological Seminary is far better than a school of theology under the trustees of the university. There is no valid objection to two schools of law or two schools of chemistry, independently controlled, but enjoying the advantages of educational affiliation with a university. Endowed research institutions and municipal, state or governmental bureaus can to advantage be placed near a university, contributing to and gaining from its educational work.</p>

    <p>Appointments and the apportionment of funds are said to be questions insoluble under democratic control. But in spite of the difficulties the case is not so bad as autocratic one-man power. If there are fixed salaries with automatic increases, only three or four decisions must be made. Shall this man be appointed instructor? Shall he be appointed junior professor after five or ten years of service as instructor? Shall he be appointed full professor after five or ten years of service as junior professor? Who shall be appointed to super-professorships, if such exist? As a matter of fact under the existing system instructors and junior professors are nearly always nominated by the department or its head. They alone have the necessary information in regard to the men and the situation. The nomination of a full professor can be entrusted better to the department concerned than to a president. But such an appointment, being for life and of immense consequence, can not be too <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page57" title="57"></span>carefully guarded. It should be passed on by a board or committee composed, say, of two members of the department, two members of allied departments and two distinguished representatives of the subject outside the university concerned. Such control would prevent undesirable inbreeding or the further deterioration of a weak department. Nominations should be made publicly—the English plan of definite candidates with printed records has much to commend it—and the power of veto should perhaps be given to the faculties as well as to the trustees.</p>

    <p>The apportionment of the existing income of a department varies but little from year to year, and can safely be left to the department. Questions arise only when an increase which the department can not itself obtain is wanted, and there are general funds available, but not sufficient to supply all the needs of the university. Under the existing system each head of department grabs for everything in sight, and the president plays the part of an inscrutable and sometimes unscrupulous providence in the semi-secret distribution of his favors. No scheme could be more demoralizing. The correct plan is for each department to draw up its budget, with requests for increases and the reasons clearly indicated, the proposed budgets being printed and open to all concerned. Under these conditions unreasonable claims would not often be made by the departments. Plans for new departments and new lines of work could also be submitted by any responsible group. An elected committee of professors, with the assistance of an expert curator or controller, would then pass on the various budgets and proposals and adjust them to the available income, the reductions made by the committee being of course published. The budget for the university would then go to the trustees. It may be objected that under this plan existing work <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page58" title="58"></span>would be strengthened rather than new ground broken. But might not this be better than the existing presidential mania for expansion? It seems in fact probable that if many professors and junior instructors were concerned, there would be more new ideas than when the initiative is left to a single man, and further that wise plans would be more likely to be adopted and inexpedient schemes to be rejected.</p>

    <p>When schools and departments have autonomy, there is no need for much super-legislation and super-administration in the university. The machinery should be as simple as may be. Departments may be united into a school or college and elect a dean and a faculty or an executive committee to coordinate the work. A department can elect members to represent it in allied departments and on the faculties of the schools and colleges with whose work it is concerned. There should be an elected council or senate to represent the entire university and an executive committee which can confer with the executive committee of the trustees. There may at times to advantage be faculty meetings or plebiscites of large groups or of all the officers of the university. Questions concerning the entire university can be discussed to advantage by the fly-leaf method of the English universities, and a vote can be taken without a general assembly at a polling booth or by mail.</p>

    <p>There are advantages and disadvantages in large faculty meetings. When all important matters are decided by administrative officers or executive committees and only trivial questions are discussed before the faculty, usually by certain polyphasiac members, its meetings are likely to fall into disrepute. Men are efficient in direct proportion to their responsibility. Further, a body of men is effective inversely as its size and directly as the time it works together. A body of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page59" title="59"></span>fifty men, such as the faculty to which I primarily belong, meeting for an hour three times a year, without power or responsibility, is clearly dedicated to futility. But if any one supposes that university presidents would do better under these conditions, he should call to mind the conduct of the trustees of the Carnegie Foundation. It seems to be the case that in order to make large faculties real legislative bodies, it would be necessary to devote more time to their meetings than is expedient, and perhaps more common sense than is available. All parliaments, congresses and legislatures do their work through cabinets and committees; but these are responsible to the whole body. Some such plan is necessary in the university. Still the cynical attitude toward faculty meetings common in academic circles appears to be one of the sinister symptoms resulting from the existing methods of autocratic control. It is typical of existing conditions that the most recent university school to be established —the School of Journalism of Columbia University—does not have a faculty, but an "administrative board." I belong to a club at the meetings of which each member must speak once and only once, not exceeding his share of the time, and the discussion is followed by a dinner. If faculty meetings could be made into educational and social clubs they would perform a useful function. The meetings of the faculty of arts and sciences at Harvard may give rise to complaints, but they have been of real service to the university.</p>

    <p>Truth, openness, publicity, are the safeguards of free institutions. It is better to wash your dirty linen in public than to continue to wear it. The affairs of a university should be conducted in the full light of day. The proceedings of the trustees, the discussions and conclusions of faculties and of committees, the activities of the president, the work of professors, salaries and the provisions<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page60" title="60"></span> of the budget, the appointment of officers and the rare cases in which it is necessary to dismiss a professor, should be open to all. Light is an excellent disinfectant; what is of more consequence, it is essential to healthy life and growth. "And God said, let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good."</p>

    <p>Several of my correspondents argue that if the control of a university were vested in its teachers they would be distracted from their proper work of teaching and research. In a recent article<a class="super_original" id="p01_c05_note03" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c05_note03">3</a> on "The University President in the American Commonwealth," President Eliot writes:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation">Most American professors of good quality would regard the imposition of duties concerning the selection of professors and other teachers, the election of the president, and the annual arrangement of the budget of the institution as a serious reduction in the attractiveness of the scholar's life and the professorial career.</blockquote>

    <p class="no_indent">Do President Eliot and the lesser presidents and the few professors who share their views believe that university professors and other citizens of a city should not concern themselves with municipal government or vote for a president of the nation? Are we of the world's greatest democracy and in the twentieth century to revert to the theory that the common people should do the daily work imposed on them, and trust to the king and his lords to care for them?</p>

    <p>In the preface to the first edition (1906) of the "Biographical Directory of American Men of Science," I wrote:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation"> There scarcely exists among scientific men the recognition of common interest and the spirit of cooperation which would help to give science the place it should have in the community. It is fully as important for the nation as for men of science that scientific work should be adequately recognized and supported. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page61" title="61"></span>We are consequently in the fortunate position of knowing that whatever we do to promote our own interests is at the same time a service to the community and to the world.</blockquote>

    <p class="no_indent">Trade-unions and organizations of professional men, in spite of occasional abuses, have been of benefit not only to those immediately concerned, but to society as a whole.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c05_note04" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c05_note04">4</a> President Eliot did not obtain commendation for calling the "scab" a hero. But if it is expedient to better the conditions under which work of any kind is done, this is of the utmost importance for education and research. If we can unite to improve the conditions of the academic career, so that it will attract the best men and permit them to do their best work, we make a contribution to the welfare of society which, is permanent and universal. It may be that the time has now come when it is desirable and possible to form an association of professors of American universities, based on associations in the different universities, the objects of which would be to promote the interests of the universities and to advance higher education and research, with special reference to problems of administration and to the status of the professors and other officers of the university.</p>

    <p>The space at my disposal is exhausted and many problems directly and indirectly concerned with the control of a university remain untouched. I am well aware that this essay is written in the spirit of the advocate and the reformer, rather than from the point of view of the judge and the responsible administrator. Against most of the suggestions which have been made valid objections may be urged. The only principle that I am prepared to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page62" title="62"></span>defend whole-heartedly is that the university should be a democracy of scholars serving the larger democracy of which it is part. A government of laws is better than a government by men; but better than either is freedom controlled by public opinion and common sense, by precedent and good-will.</p>
