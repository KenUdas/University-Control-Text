    <h2 class="calibre9">IX. Letters from Institutions in New England</h2>

    <p>If I should venture a purely academic opinion on the plan it would be that you attach far too little weight to the argument of efficiency. That, to my mind, is the only decisive argument— efficiency being understood to mean the accomplishment of the purposes of research and teaching for which universities are created. If a more democratic organization means more of that sort of efficiency it will surely come; if it doesn't, it will not. Probably no single plan of organization would do in all institutions of the same size and grade. Some groups of men are fitter for successful democracy than others.</p>

    <p>Your plan of university control seems to me rather complicated—perhaps because I have lived so long in a small college. Here we have great centralization of power in the president. He appoints all committees and is <i>ex officio</i> member of all and chairman of most. I have been here in three administrations, and the views of the president gave the college its special character in each. One of the three lacked force and control and the conditions then were the worst I have known. Faculty cliques arose, developing jealousies and ill feelings in large measure. I was at the Hopkins from 1876 to 1881. President Oilman was the university in large measure. His wisdom in choices and decisions and his genuine, unfailing interest in every one connected with the university won success. His great concern was to make others succeed. I never saw-or heard of any personal self-interest, and I saw a great deal of him in the university and in his home.</p>

    <p>There are many points upon which we agree, but in regard to the salient point which comes under your section (2), I do not agree with you at all. I know there are many poor college presidents, but I have little faith in the general business wisdom or judgment of college faculties and I think a strong president who allows himself to be influenced by the good judgment of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page147" title="147"></span>better members of his faculty is far to be preferred to the method you outline. I believe the same general principles applied to the management of a successful corporation apply to college or university management and believe the method used at Cornell far superior to that at Yale.</p>

    <p>I think it is necessary and absolutely essential that the president should have more power and should have more salary and a position somewhat more eminent than that of a professor. That this power is grossly misused at times is notorious, but we must consider the university situation as a whole rather than an extremely small minority of a situation. The German "Rektor" has many advantages, but it is based upon a great many decades of experience and upon usually excellent administrative routine that allows but very little flexibility or growth, and is not designed to meet the influx of new questions which is continually arising in our new American universities.</p>

    <p>I am interested in your suggestions, and I sympathize with the general spirit of which they are the expression—a spirit of opposition to the present tendency to make the president an autocrat. Nevertheless, I can not believe that the plan which you propose would be a practicable one. I doubt the wisdom of having all the trustees elected by a large democratic body composed chiefly of the alumni. I believe a composite board in which part of the members are elected by the alumni and part by the board itself would be better, as having a certain guarantee of conservatism. I think you go too far in making a temporary chairman of the faculty, instead of a president. Under present conditions, I think an American university needs a president with pretty large powers, in order to secure unity and efficiency of administration. Great administrative capacity is rarer than scholarship, capacity for scientific research and pedagogic aptitude. Especially rare is the combination of great administrative capacity with high scholarly qualities; and just that combination practically is demanded of a college president. It seems to me, therefore, that the American university must have a president whose position must be recognized as higher and whose emolu-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page148" title="148"></span>ments must be greater than those of a professor. In a German university the relation of the institution to the state renders a strong administrative power in the institution itself unnecessary. The autonomy of the American university requires an effective administrative head. I do not believe in abolishing the president, but in making him a limited monarch rather than an autocrat. I think professors should be nominated by the president with the concurrence of a senate or body representing the professors. So long as a college is small, this senate may include all the full professors. As the institution increases in size, the senate must become a representative body, probably best constituted by election by the whole body of full professors. The election of professors would be made by the trustees, and would generally be merely a formal ratification of the nomination by the president and senate.</p>

    <p>In answer to your propositions, my opinion is as follows: (1) I am not in favor of your proposed scheme. I do not believe that we can plan all our universities exactly alike, and the controlling bodies in each develop more or less according to the needs of the institution. I think as a rule the governing boards, if we except a few instances in the middle west, have not interfered very much with the duties of the faculty, and so serve their purpose fairly well in most cases as at present constituted. (2) I am partially opposed to your view on this. I believe we still need the university president in our system of education, and the chief way that I would limit his power as compared with present conditions would be to make the matter of the selection of new professors, etc., largely one of conference between the president and the members of the faculty directly concerned. (3) As I understand this proposition, I am in favor of it. (4) I agree with this proposition in the main, except that I believe the president should have some voice in the selection of the faculty, and I think it doubtful whether the election of professors for life at all institutions is desirable. (5) I am in favor of this proposition only in case it does not usurp the powers of the president and trustees, but merely limits them without destroying their efficiency.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page149" title="149"></span>It seems to me the question turns on the decision whether we should delegate large powers to a few, or make university control more democratic. It is about the same question that the country is facing in city government. I believe a man must have responsibility and power if he is to accomplish anything. The chief criticism which I can present to your plan is that it spreads out too thinly this responsibility. The position of chancellor as outlined would appeal to no man of force. The president would be solely an educational adviser to the faculty. Lack of a president at the University of Virginia impeded greatly the value of the university to the state for many years. According to your plan the professor is too free. I believe he should feel that he is but part of the educational system, and that his work should bear a relation to the system. His own wishes should be governed by a clear appreciation of these facts. Autonomy in the government of departments is good, but if carried too far leads to differences in methods, standards and aims, which should not exist in a university. I fear the putting of financial matters in the hands of the divisions would yield bad results. There must be begging—but keep that from the teaching force and the deans. Briefly, I believe in more centralization than you outline. I think in certain instances the power delegated to college presidents has been misused, that some are autocrats and should be subjected to control. If we could find some mean path between what we have now and what you propose we should be nearer the solution of the problem. Among the things that should be looked to are the following that suggest themselves at this time: Representation on the board of trustees, corporation or other governing body of the faculty. It does not seem right that the only official source of communication between trustees and those who are actually doing the work of education should be the president. The separation of educational and administrative problems. Many heads of departments are clerks. Provide that each professor do what he can do best. Don't make an investigator spend hours discussing in committee the number of points required for admission, etc. Make it possible, in some way, to get rid of inefficient men in the instructing corps. There are many professors who are hindering the proper work that should <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page150" title="150"></span>be done. Make it possible for a really good man to advance as his work warrants. The lock-step system has disadvantages as well as advantages. Find a way to list, if possible, the educational efficiency of the instructing corps. I think much more harm has been done in educational institutions by retaining inefficient men than by putting out such men.</p>

    <p>In general we have been particularly happy here under almost completely democratic government. Under the present administration things are changing. The faculty is being relieved of much of the old routine work. With this relief I believe its powers in vital matters are also being gradually reduced. The process seems automatic. For the small college at least number (2) will not be generally workable. The president's work is less pleasant, more exacting, more responsible, and more wearing than that of any professor. He has much entertaining to do, an official residence to maintain, and semi-official obligations to the community. He couldn't live on our salaries. He receives more than double the highest professor's salary. But no one of us would take the job if it were offered to us. We believe very strongly in the life tenure of professors. But I believe there ought to be some extrinsic reward for efficiency. That should not be left entirely to inner stimulus and conscience. For us there is no way to an increase in salary except a call elsewhere. Perhaps that is not a bad criterion of ability. At any rate I believe the possibility of such a call and consequent raise is better than purely automatic increases regardless of reputation or efficiency.</p>

    <p>In a general way I can see that your plan would work better on theoretical grounds than the present one, but what would be the result in actual practise I can not tell. Certainly I think it would be a gain were there more articulation between faculty and trustees than at present, but, knowing something of the personnel of faculties and the cranks that often get in, I think that I would rather have the autocracy of a carefully chosen president than the rule of some members of faculties that I have known. I notice that you do not say whether the trustees should <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page151" title="151"></span>be elected for a term of years, as in state universities, or for an indefinite term, as in most institutions. I think that the limited term is better, as there are often members of the board who are worse than useless, and there is no way of getting rid of them, save by poison. They have such ideas of their own importance that there is no hope of getting them to resign, and death is the only escape. I like the idea of having members of the faculty select the professors as you suggest in article (4). In fact I have always been consulted with regard to all appointments to positions in any way allied to my own department, and frequently with regard to others. But I know of one of the largest universities where the president does not consult with any of the biological department, but makes the appointments himself, and he is not a biologist. I think that there are too many faculty meetings. Most matters are better settled by small committees, for they are but matters of routine. Meetings of the faculty of a school or group need be held but three or four times a year, and then at such an hour as to prevent needless wind-chewing and thinking out loud. I regret that I can not discuss your plan more intelligently. On the whole it appeals to me, but for twenty years I have managed to fit in pretty well with existing conditions. I have not wanted any more share in the management than I have at present. I dodge all committees where possible, as I want to put my time on other work. I have also been allowed great freedom in every respect and have not suffered from any autocracy, but that of course is due to the personal characteristics of the presidents and not to any merit of the existing scheme.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that your first point is a very important one. There should, indeed, be a corporation to include all those vitally interested in the university or college. This should certainly include the professors and officers, as well as the alumni, and should be so made up that it would have the best chance of wisely guiding the general trend of the institution and limiting the field which it should cover. I should like to see some college experiment by adding representatives of the parents and students. The board of trustees selected by them should be more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page152" title="152"></span>than ordinary trustees, in that, beside the care of property, they should act as a committee on policy, as in the American Association, while at the same time they should not be a close ring. (2) I doubt the wisdom of separating the functions of a chancellor who represents the university at public functions, and may stand before the community as the embodiment of its ideals, from that of president. If the president's position is no more "dignified" or his powers no greater than those of a professor, he would, I fear, become simply a professor of pedagogics, and might narrow the scope of the institution. If thus stripped of its present scope, I see no reason why his work should not be given, as you suggest, to an elected chairman of the faculty or to the deans. I do think, however, that in any institution and in politics, even after all "progressive" steps have been taken, there will be an important field for the one leader. The object must be to restrain leadership from becoming tyranny, and to remember that in the search for truth, and the dissemination thereof, progress must be in many directions. (3) The department is a very important unit, and I think you are right regarding the size —that is, should be somewhere from ten to twenty. It should, of course, have "as complete autonomy as is consistent with the welfare of the university as a whole," but my impression is that there is always a strife both for students' time and for funds between the different departments. Just how such strife is to be settled must depend upon some larger body. (5) As I understand it, the "larger body" above referred to is a senate coordinate with the trustees. Whether there would not be friction between these two bodies and just how their relations would be is a point where your plan is open to question. My impression is that I should recommend very strongly the system of public hearings, that in matters concerning any man or any department a hearing should be had before the committee or body which shall finally decide upon the same, and that in case of important matters, a man or department should have the right and power to go before the committee on policy or executive committee of the whole institution, with an ultimate appeal to the corporation which selects that committee. It seems to me, too, that not only teachers, but also students, should, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page153" title="153"></span>as in the medieval universities, have their own part in the corporation, and balance by the rashness and radicalism of youth the conservatism of the alumni. The important matter is that the fact should be recognized that the teacher is not merely a hired man of a corporation, but has a vital interest and pride in the institution which he serves, and is quite likely able to help it in more ways than his narrow specialty. For instance, many professors in many institutions are men of large means, and are fully as able to give good financial advice as members of the board of trustees. Again, I am sure that many institutions have made mistakes by not giving their engineering faculty a chance to advise in the planning of new buildings and in similar works. With regard to professors, it seems to me that no general rule can be maintained. In certain departments it is natural and inevitable that the professor's time should be almost wholly devoted to his university work. In other departments, I believe the best results are obtained by having one who is doing things tell others how he is doing them, and that in many cases (law, medicine, engineering) men may receive a good part of their income from other sources than their university salaries. It seems hardly possible to cover in any one plan of university control all the possible varieties that can come up, and I hardly think that your plan means to do that, but that, as you say, "there should be as much flexibility" (not only throughout the university but from one institution to another) "as is consistent with" true efficiency. That seems to be the scientific method of work. We should have many university organizations, so that by comparison we can find the better forms. One of the criticisms which I should make is that our universities are far too much alike in their general plan of administration. They vary in name, but the various parts are not so varied in function.</p>

    <p>The central feature of the plan you propose, namely, a representative basis of control, seems an excellent one, applicable alike to the small college and the great university. Those of our colleges that place the election of certain trustees in the hands of the alumni already enjoy a large measure of representative government. To restrict this suffrage to those of the alumni who <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page154" title="154"></span>are willing to pay annual dues may offer some advantage, but it would be a mistake, I think, to have the dues much more than nominal in amount. The suggestion that membership in the corporation be extended more generally to members of the faculty and to interested citizens is a good one, under suitable restrictions. I am heartily in accord with the proposal that the president be elected by the professors, subject to the approval of the trustees, though I should want to have him more than a mere presiding officer. American universities still need presidents, not merely vice-presidents. For this reason I should not like to see a new rector elected every year, as in Germany. Such an arrangement would be almost as objectionable as would the annual election of president of the United States. A four-year term for the university president would be better than this— but I have still to be convinced that an indefinite tenure of office is not best suited to our varied and changing conditions.</p>

    <p>A first-class president can be more successful than a whole army of poorly qualified professors. But democracy must prevail in spite of bad legislation—and if the democracy prevails, the president is of no account, and he is no more dignified than a professor. In my day we seventy-five instructors delegated six of our number to handle all the vexatious questions that came before us, subject to the approval of the others. This plan worked well, but the decisions were sometimes overruled. I am inclined to think that if more pains are taken in the selection of trustees, and they take the necessary time to attend to the general management of the institution, good results will follow. Perhaps some of them could give all their time to their charge, upon salaries. My experience with treasurers is not favorable. They are of smaller caliber than the president and after a while become domineering and almost insulting. In general I will say that I approve your efforts to improve the methods of university control; that the present system (or that which has been employed) has not been satisfactory; and that the democracy is theoretically the true method of control. I see now more of business corporations than before. Their affairs are managed by directors—usually dominated by a president or manager. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page155" title="155"></span>The problems are very much the same with those of the university and perhaps something could be learned from them. So the most successful churches are those dominated by bishops. The presidents and bishops are carefully selected and usually do well. If not, the business or church concerned must suffer, just like the university.</p>

    <p>In general purpose and outline the proposed plan of organization is a decided improvement on present methods of control. Details would naturally be worked out differently in different institutions, but if the evolution of a considerable number of universities could be directed along the proposed lines the effectiveness of both instruction and research would be greatly increased. Some institutions, with liberal charters, are perhaps free to develop toward the ideal organization provided those in control can be convinced of its feasibility and advantages. On the other hand many college and university charters are of such an iron-clad nature as to prevent any change in ultimate control. In such cases development could not be directed along the proposed lines without encountering serious legal difficulties, and the institutions concerned could not be expected to undertake the reorganization until its advantages have been clearly demonstrated elsewhere. The suggested appointment of a chancellor and a president to share some of the duties now vested in the president alone would relieve some of the friction in the present organization and might possibly be carried out while the ultimate control is still in the hands of the trustees. Some boards have, for a number of years, delegated the control of educational policy to the faculty and have seldom declined to ratify the action of the latter body in such matters. They might with equal propriety allow the faculty, or a suitable committee appointed by the professors, to nominate the president with the tacit understanding that the nomination would be respected. Such a procedure would tend to curtail the autocratic power of the president and would present many of the advantages of the proposed plan. Also the chance of securing suitably qualified men would probably be greater than by the present method. A man nominated for the presidency by the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page156" title="156"></span>faculty, or a committee of the professors, would be recognized by them as a leader in educational and administrative matters. Under these conditions I see no objection to allowing him considerably more power and compensation than is suggested in the proposed plan. Most faculties would be likely to progress very slowly along general educational lines without active leadership from some source. A suitably qualified president might appropriately assume the initiative in such matters, the final decision resting with the professors or their elected representatives. The general oversight of administrative details and the formulation of educational policy require considerable time and specialized abilities. For this reason I believe that it would be better to vest these functions in a single individual who could devote his entire time and energy to the purpose rather than to trust to the varying abilities of annually elected rectors. While an institution organized on the lines suggested in sections three and four of your article would be ideal from the point of view of the individual, it would require some centralizing influence in order to become an effective power in the community. This influence could be exerted, without interfering with the obvious advantages of the proposed plan, by a department of administration and policy headed by a president who owes his appointment and powers to the concurrent will of the trustees and the professors. Such a department would be organized on a different basis from the other departments of the institution and, to some extent, would be subservient to them. Its principal functions would be to investigate the educational and scientific needs of the community or other constituency of the institution, to formulate plans for meeting these needs, and to lay such plans before the faculty of the departments concerned for discussion and action. It should be expected to keep in touch with the secondary schools, to suggest modifications in entrance requirements when they become necessary, and to administer faculty regulations regarding scholarships and discipline. It might also be charged with the supervision of the official publications of the institution.</p>

    <p>The article, I think, is a good one. The only matter in which I would take issue with it is in that of a chancellor to obtain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page157" title="157"></span>endowments, etc. This work should be done as it is so generally, I believe, by the president.</p>

    <p>Your plan of university control, as stated in an article received a short time back, appears to me to be very good.</p>

    <p>I should heartily approve the plan set forth in your article as a desirable, but far distant, ideal. For our smaller colleges I wish that a small committee elected by the faculty could form part of the trustees. Your method of electing professors seems to me a little too complex.</p>

    <p>In general I should be strongly in favor of your proposed form of organization for larger universities. The first proposition is particularly important and I believe should apply to other than the largest universities. The fundamental principle of vesting the interests of such institutions as are of wide and general benefit in a large, representative corporation, with trustees as agents, is sound and democratic. Moreover great hospitals and similar institutions more recently founded have demonstrated its feasibility.</p>

    <p>The reform in university government which you advocate is, I think, in the right direction. Without wasting time in emphasizing the respects in which I approve of it, I will confine my remarks to the single feature in which I do not think it so satisfactory. I doubt whether two coordinate boards, trustees and senate as described by you, the former controlling financial, and the latter purely educational, interests, would work well. One would soon dominate the other; and, as the former would hold the power of the purse, the contest would be unequal. Moreover its inauguration would require a sudden revolution and would not come as an evolution by a gradual succession of minor changes, which I believe to be the only way in which such a large change can be brought about. Much more is to be hoped, I believe, from an attempt to gradually reform our present boards of trustees by the appointment to them of educational experts elected by staffs of teachers. Our present boards consist generally of conscientious business and professional men, of more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page158" title="158"></span>than average ability, who have no wide acquaintance with educational requirements and policies. They are in general men of open mind and good general judgment, and what they chiefly need to increase their efficiency greatly is the advice and cooperation, on equal terms, of experts in educational questions. A first step toward this would be the appointment of a small committee of advisers, elected by the departments for limited periods, who must be consulted by the trustees in regard to specified educational questions, such as appointments. The enlargement of the number of subjects for consultation might gradually follow with a final fusion of the two bodies. I think there is a possibility of unwise haste and lack of full consideration in the attempt to bring about such a highly desirable change as you advocate. Would it not be well to print in Science brief clear abstracts of the methods of government in several typical efficient foreign universities, so that as many as possible might be stimulated to think carefully about what long experience and gradual adjustments have worked out as efficient systems? I would suggest outlines of the government of an English, a Scotch, a German, a French, and an Italian university, prepared by ones who have imbibed something of the spirit of these.</p>

    <p>If a portion, for example, one third, of the existing board of trustees were elected by the faculty from their own number, another third similarly elected from the alumni, and the remaining third were prominent citizens, the latter portion being possibly self-perpetuating, I believe the advantages of article (1) would be secured and that some such modification might be realized. I believe most strongly in your suggestion of a chancellor, who will perform the public duties now expected of a president. Article (2) suggests a most desirable and important change. The public duties of a president being delegated to a chancellor, the more important educational responsibilities can best be carried by one in close touch with the faculty, elected by the faculty from among their own number, for a term of years. Articles (3), (4) and (5) : I believe that each department should elect representatives to a university council and that this council, composed of elected representatives from the different depart-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page159" title="159"></span>merits, should have general supervision and control over the general policy of each department. The acts of the council would similarly be subject to review by the trustees. The members of each department should, as a body, make recommendations for vacancies in the department, and, if not vetoed by council or trustees, such nominations should be the basis of election. In my opinion the evils to be eradicated are the subserviency of president to trustees (or corporation), directors of departments to president, and department staff to director. The most serious result of the present system is the advancement of mediocre men with "pull" and the neglect of men of marked ability who will not adopt the tactics of the politician.</p>

    <p>I find myself in favor of most of the principles which you advocate in your article on university control. Especially I am in favor of the democratic principle which you outline. But I am not sure that your conception of the position of president, as set forth in the four lines you give to the discussion of that office, is that which would make for the highest educational and administrative efficiency. (1) The corporation. I believe that your idea of a corporation is already practically in use. In old and well-established institutions the alumni constitute the corporation. "Members of the community who ally themselves with it" are generally voted into the alumni by the trustees, using the medium of honorary degrees or "degrees as in course." The English and Canadian universities have provided a means whereby a college man already the holder of a degree from some university or college of good standing may become an alumnus of another university upon the recommendation by (four or five) alumni and by the payment of a fee. Consequently it is an easy matter to enlarge the alumni to include all beneficiaries of the university who desire to mould its policies. (2) The president. When I first read your article I assumed you meant that the professors . . . should elect from their own number a president. Perhaps you do not mean this. There seems no good reason why the professors should not go outside their own number for a suitable man. But if his salary were no larger nor his position more dignified than that of a professor, there would be no need <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page160" title="160"></span>of going outside. I am inclined to think however that his position would be more dignified by the mere fact of his election. And, too, he ought to have some powers which a professor does not have—otherwise there would be no necessity for his election. While I regard as making for the gaiety of nations the transformation which an ordinary man undergoes when he is elected president of a college, whereby he becomes possessed overnight of both omnipotence and omniscience, still I should attach to the position the dignity and responsibility which should rightly belong to the chosen executive of a democratic body. But to give such an executive very great powers or to pay him a salary three times as much as is paid to the ablest professors in the university (as is now done in some cases) would be to exalt the office of president out of all proportion to its real place in an educational institution. (3), (4), (5) Details of organization. On the whole, I am in accord with the details of organization, but I do not feel that it is necessary or advisable to pay the same salary for the same office, nor do I believe that election to a professorship should be for life. Indeed, I am strongly of the belief that it should be clearly set forth by the faculty that membership in that body is dependent upon the maintenance by its members of their mental and moral sanity. In a footnote (9) you state that "professors and other officers should not be distracted from their work of teaching and research by administrative politics." But some professors must do administrative work. College organizations of all kinds—musical clubs, dramatic clubs, athletics, publications, all need the friendly counsel of members of the faculty.</p>

    <p>In general I may say that I am in cordial sympathy with the efforts you are making to bring about a betterment of university conditions. It is obvious to any one not himself a direct beneficiary by reason of the existence of the evils of the prevailing system of university administration, either through being a president or the petted tool of a president, that a continuation of present conditions can only result in placing the intellectual life of American universities on a lower level than it has occupied in the past or than is occupied by the universities of other countries. This is inevitable for two reasons: In the first place an academic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page161" title="161"></span>career is becoming all the time less attractive to men of marked intellectual capacity and ability. This applies not merely to young men of this class at the beginning of their careers who are turning to other fields, where not only is the remuneration larger, but where the opportunity for a free and untrammeled intellectual development in the widest sense of the word is greater. It also applies to men who have attained eminence in university work, but who are finding conditions increasingly irksome and are only awaiting the right opportunity to leave the university. In the second place, the insistence upon a system of military subordination with its attendant train of evils, the loading of men down with innumerable routine duties of a petty character which could be better performed by clerks, and the "carrying of the university to the people" in the form of extension work, are in their very nature bound to divert the best part of the energy of the faculty (in spite of their efforts, strenuous at first, to the contrary) into channels which are intellectually on a low level. He who doubts this or who has not seen the gradual breaking down under the pressure of the system of many a promising man's ideals and ambition has not been around the universities long, or is afflicted with academic myopia. I believe that your scheme for the amelioration of these conditions is, in the main, sound. I should, however, like to mention certain matters of detail respecting each of your points taken <i>seriatim</i>. (1) The state universities seem to me to offer a real difficulty to the corporation plan. I doubt if the people would delegate authority to elect regents to a faculty-alumni corporation, and lacking this authority the corporation would lose a good deal, though not all, of its effectiveness. (2) I feel strongly that before we shall make much progress we must adopt the German plan of no president, but a short-term rector. Years of tradition have given a connotation to the very name "university president" in this country which makes it desirable to the interest of reform to do away with the office entirely. Let the rector be the academic head for a one, two or three year term, he to be chosen by the faculty; let there be then chosen by the corporation a chancellor or provost, who shall have no authority over any officer of the university (except his own clerks), nor any greater <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page162" title="162"></span>voice respecting its intellectual policy that any other member of the corporation. His function shall be to represent the university at public functions and before legislative bodies, and solicit funds. He must be a wealthy man, chosen because of his position in the world, and preferably serving without salary. (3) Agreed to fully. (4) Agreed to as modified by footnote 8. I question the advisability of uniform salaries for all full professors, at least until conditions shall have very considerably changed and a new body of traditions been built up. (5) Agreed to fully. Finally there is one further point I should like to mention, as I have not seen it lately discussed except from one side. This is the dictum that the university exists primarily or solely for the students (and the "people" in the ultra-modern and "efficient" universities like Wisconsin). This dictum has of late been very frequently expressed and represents, I believe, the nearly universal opinion of the, at present, constituted "authorities" of American universities, including presidents, trustees, the Carnegie Foundation, etc. This opinion I believe to be a logical outgrowth of the autocratic system of university control. It prevails, so far as my experience goes, in no other country in the world. It constitutes in its implications the most fundamental and serious menace not only to the future of our universities, but to the future intellectual development and standing of the nation. This doctrine is utterly pernicious because it completely misconceives the function of a university, which is twofold in nature. On the one hand, it is the business of a university to distribute from the existing fund of knowledge. On the other hand, an absolutely equal coordinate function of the university is to add to the existing store of knowledge. Only within a few years has there been any organized institution other than the university to perform this function, and always we must look to the university as the chief and foremost agency in this direction. It seems to me to be to the shame and disgrace of American scholars that they have allowed a system to grow up which refuses to recognize, in a real and vital sense, contribution to knowledge as an independent and coordinate function of a university. Probably nearly every college president in the land would say if asked that he "approved of research." But a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page163" title="163"></span>straightforward business proposal to devote one half of the total resources of a university directly and unequivocally and freely to the purpose of extending the bounds of human knowledge would produce an epidemic of presidential heart failure fearful to imagine. Such a thing is obviously out of the question in this enlightened land. But, what is not impracticable, and what I wish to emphasize, is that it be clearly recognized that in theory if not in practise the function of a university is just precisely as much to add to knowledge as to teach, and in so far as the university exists for research it exists not primarily for the students or the "people" but for the men who are doing the research. Its debt to them is no less than to the others, and if it can not be paid materially some part of it can be paid morally. Let us all never forget to insist, in season and out, that in a university research is a right and a duty, not merely an individually and dearly bought or stolen privilege.</p>

    <p>I am heartily in sympathy with your article. In my opinion the hysterics which prompt all the universities of the country to rush per delegation to the scene of the inauguration of a new college president, as if it were to the coming of a new messiah, is little short of ludicrous. From another point of view, to see a man like President ------ celebrated in oil, at the University of Berlin as the beau ideal of American scholarship, in the very halls which have witnessed the flights of genius of a von Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, Planck, Curtius, Fischer, Monsen, van't Hoff, Ranke (to mention only a few) is similarly discouraging.</p>

    <p>(1) I fully join in the opinion that the present form of university government could not be worse, and that American science will not attain its optimum as long as our superior schools are under the control of philistine outsiders. (2) The system of university control which you propose is extremely attractive to me in practically all its points, and I thoroughly believe that its introduction would mark the dawn of day in American scholarship. (3) It is my belief that expression of opinion alone, timidly anonymous opinion at that, will not avail much. Something should be done. Nothing could give me greater pleasure <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page164" title="164"></span>than to help you in every possible way to extend the influence of your ideas.</p>

    <p>I agree with it in <i>toto</i>. Universities, of all things human, ought to be most completely and plastically and democratically organized. Our present autocratic system is a great national calamity and discredit. It is certainly the great obstacle to free and rapid advance of research in this country. If I were appointed a university president, I would hold the office just long enough to write my resignation and organize a committee to draw up plans for a completely democratic form of university government. The plan should not admit of "dirty politics" either, and we should have all matters of salary and departmental appropriations absolutely in the open and on the square. The idea of setting a "boss" over a group of men of professorial rank is hideous. To give him the "whip hand" to the extent of, even practically, determining fitness and tenure is tantamount to public legalization of murder. The above is exactly what I think of our present system of university government. Anything that I can do to improve it will be gladly done.</p>
