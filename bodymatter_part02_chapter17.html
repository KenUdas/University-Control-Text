    <h2 class="calibre9">XVII. Letters from Private Institutions in the Central and Western States</h2>

    <p>I can see some excellent advantages in the system which you advocate, and it seems to me it has some fatal defects. In thinking the matter over, I have tried to recall my own experience as a professor and the criticisms which I made in regard to presidential and trustee control. I can remember that I desired above all things to be given a free hand in my own department; that I wanted to be able to plan out my work according to my own views of what ought to be done, and then to be able to carry out these plans unhampered. I wanted also a staff under me that would help me to do this, and it seemed to me that I could not succeed in any other way. Of course, this is pure autocratic control in a department and I have never been able to see how a department can be successfully managed without this autocratic control. If there are a good many professors and instructors in a department, and the department meets as a body to legislate on the work which is to be done, a plan of action can be arrived at which will meet with the approval of the majority, at least, but after this plan is settled it must be executed and it seems to me that one man must execute the wishes of the department and must have absolute power to do so. I have found in my experience with college professors, both as a professor and as a president, that it is exceedingly difficult to get them to agree upon any proposition and I am sure that they would disagree in regard to executive control in a department, although they might be able to come together in a legislative way. Here, in this small engineering college, we try to give absolute freedom to each head of department so far as that freedom can be given and not interfere with the work of other departments. It seems to work admirably, and yet I am conscious of the fact that our departments are very small and that we might meet with an entirely different set of propositions if we had six or eight full professors in one department. I have been brought in quite close contact with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page278" title="278"></span>business men during the past few years—with men who have large personal interests and with men who control corporations—and I find that in all of these efficiency is obtained only through an executive who is practically-in supreme control, although amenable, of course, to the decision of the board of trustees which meets occasionally. You do not need to say to me that efficiency in a business organization is entirely different from efficiency in a college. I realize that every day, but I do think that there are problems of administration in every educational institution which a representative form of government, with no executive except a temporary one, would have great difficulty in meeting. I believe that the faculty should be freely consulted in regard to executive and administrative problems and that their knowledge and wisdom should aid the president at times; but my experience has been that after all there should be some one person who would finally decide and who could be held responsible by the governing body, and it does seem to me that that governing body should elect the executive.</p>

    <p>I quite agree with you that university control can not be a simple democracy, and that it should not be a despotism. You note that I put the other end of the idea in front. The German idea that the faculty should have full charge is not workable for long or for large. That our present system tempts a man to select men lacking in character, individuality and genius is true only to the extent that a president has to be a balance wheel for the institution, and eccentric people disarrange all the machinery, and a large part of his time is frittered away in his effort to keep things running smoothly. Of course, I am going on the theory that he is a man with proper ideals. Every president who rises above mediocrity owes his reputation and the reputation of the institution over which he presides to the men of character, individuality and genius in his faculty. Without such men a genuine university is simply out of the question. I venture this suggestion also in regard to any plan for running a university by a corporation or a committee chosen by the alumni, by the faculty, or by the community: the moment this organization fails to agree you have pandemonium; and fail it surely must, for the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page279" title="279"></span>simple reason that it is not selected with any view of its working harmoniously. In regard to a president with the same salary and no greater powers than those of other members of the faculty, I can speak with some feeling and from a good many years of experience. In the first place a live, productive member of a faculty who must drop the work in which he is especially interested in order to look after administrative duties is entitled to some sort of compensation. Though I have looked after such matters for years, my salary has not been increased and my scientific work has not only suffered, but for long periods it has had to be practically abandoned, to my great chagrin and to the loss of my department. Furthermore the assumption of the presidential functions imposes certain social duties that cost a lot of money and can not be avoided. It would clear up this part of the problem if you could know how much social functions cost our university presidents. It is claimed, on the other hand, that there are plenty of members of the faculty who would be glad to take over these duties without extra compensation. I readily admit that such is the case. Indeed we could get a whole train load of them on a day's notice. But a university that would be satisfied with most of these men must be beyond hope. With the idea that men and women should not be subject to the whims of an individual, I am in perfect accord. But I also think that the converse is equally true—that a president should not be subject to the whims of a faculty. That many faculty members are whimsical calls for no demonstration. Neither should this whimsicality be accounted as anything against the faculty as such. A president who has the necessary balance and breadth of mind and bigness of heart will be very patient of the eccentricities of his individual faculty members, but he should not be governed by the eccentricities. I have in mind the case of a remarkably able and productive scholar who was engaged by a certain institution to prepare a scholarly work that he alone was capable of producing. But, being a very whimsical man, he was soon in the meshes of machinery and red tape, and was promptly dropped by the institution. The president of the university, recognizing the ability of the man, makes all sorts of allowances for him and lets him do his work in his own way, and the results are splendid. But that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page280" title="280"></span>same president would find it quite impossible to be guided by a number of men of this type. One other point: your last sentence says "there should be as much flexibility and as complete anarchy throughout the university as is consistent with unity and order." I believe the idea to be excellent, but unfortunately there is a large number of our professors who would have it read so: "There should be complete anarchy throughout the university." If a well-balanced, broad-minded man of high ideals and with the necessary patience is put in charge of these anarchists he can get good results, but my experience of mankind is that the man in charge is quite as essential to the good results as any other element of the problem.</p>

    <p>(1) It does not look to me practicable to elect trustees by so loose an organization as the one you suggest. It would prove too great a temptation to academic or trustee politicians to run the politics of the organization. A better notion, to my idea, would be the election of representative committees by the alumni, by the faculty, by the trustees, etc., these committees then to meet and elect the trustees or submit candidates for ratification by their respective bodies. (2) I do not quite understand what division of functions you would make between the proposed chancellor and the proposed president, functions at present united generally under those of the president. Assuming, however, that the usual functions were united in one person—the president—it seems to me necessary that a person of more than ordinary judgment, general understanding of administrative duties, and executive capacity should hold that position and should receive commensurate remuneration. Professors should not be called upon to give their attention to the vast amount of business and executive detail, nor can I conceive that they would be willing to assume its burden even temporarily for short terms without extra remuneration—provided they were capable of such administration, which the average professor holding the place <i>ex officio</i>, or in rotation, would not always be. Automatic increases in salary are not always desirable, automatic promotions would be still less so, even if the finances of the university should permit, which in most cases at present is not the case. (3) I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page281" title="281"></span>approve of the separate department organizations, whether the number of members be three or twenty. Such a system has been practised here for several years. (4) I prefer the appointment of the heads of departments by the president, as equally efficient and as obviating occasions of partisanship growing up in small groups of teachers who should be able to retain harmonious relations. Adequate limitations of the autocratic powers of the head of a department by the organization of the department faculty sufficiently safeguards this from abuse, while the appointment by the president ensures better cooperation of all departments with the president, an extremely desirable object. (5) Representative government of committees by election by faculty is desirable. The details of organization of such committees, executive committees, senates, etc., would vary much with different organizations and my own ideas are better expressed by the organization existing in this university. I do not understand, however, what is meant by the senate being a body coordinate with the trustees—for, after all, the trustees in control of the funds are in that domain supreme, and the other functions of the bodies could not be the same. Their responsibilities would be different and coordination could not be effective, unless you could give the senate the power to dismiss a trustee for cause, as the trustees can dismiss a professor for cause. As for the desirability of "as complete anarchy ... as is consistent with unity and order," I think most of our universities have about as much of anarchy as average academic human nature is prepared for.</p>

    <p>It would seem that the main question concerns the executive conduct of the details within an institution, and the simpler plan for the best efficiency and the least friction. I assume that now no one can escape the conviction that the present commercial conditions have so far penetrated the atmosphere of every educational institution that in their greater expansion it is inevitable that commercial methods be adopted in the executive government and that the affairs within the institution be reduced to a routine business system. While in every institution there are some capable business men on the faculty, it is a well-known fact that the great body of teachers have little liking for business affairs—no <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page282" title="282"></span>great business capacity. It is no reflection; it follows in consequence of their occupation and their attitude of mind. It is also well recognized as the guiding principle of modern business that in only one way can its affairs be satisfactorily and economically administered, and that is by a capable head with adequate authority. In great business systems it follows from necessity that the various lines centering in the head are best managed each by a competent head. I therefore can not escape the conviction that the vast amount of business in modern educational institutions can be satisfactorily handled only by the machine method of the great business corporation. The function of the teacher must be to teach. Heads of departments must find time for the routine business under their control and do what teaching they can. I can not see that it makes any difference who selects the president so long as it is the best man, but the presidential office must from the situation be in close touch with the board of trustees, wherein lodges the final authority. I think the president should be also president of the board of trustees or at least a member of that board. Referring to the article in <i>Science</i>, from what is said above, it appears that I do not look on the plan therein set forth in (2) as desirable. In (3), each sub-unit should be the department, wherein are managed the details of its inner organization. The unit should be the faculty and its committees, before which should be brought matters concerning the departments in general, properly digested for concise deliberation. While it would seem that there is a greater difference than seems desirable between the salaries paid professors and that paid the president, in many instances, I think that of the president ought to be somewhat larger; for example, $5,000 for a president and $3,500 for a full professor. As I understand the gist of the <i>Science</i> article, its principal contention is a limitation of the powers of the president; as a matter of fact in all bodies of men working in a common field there is bound to be a leader; if the powers of the president are limited, some other individual will come forward who will in some way or another exert the controlling influence with danger of undesirable results.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page283" title="283"></span>I am not in favor of the plan proposed as a whole. It seems to me to have some excellent features. On the other hand, it is my opinion that some of the principal proposed features are essentially a mistake. To make my opinion clear to a reader together with the basis of the opinion would require a much longer and more carefully prepared letter than I now have time to write. I believe that executive duties must always be performed by one man, or a very small group with very definite divisions of responsibility, if such duties are to be performed efficiently. In this belief, apparently, I am decidedly different from you and our differences in opinion in regard to the best plan of university control apparently arise largely from this one fundamental difference in our ideas.</p>

    <p>I should not like to see instituted the greater number of your suggestions with regard to the university. While I do not belong to the administrative branch of the university I am a believer in the centralization of authority in the board of trustees, the president and the deans of the various colleges. These officers should be men of affairs and particularly good administrators. They should relieve the professors of all such duties outside of their own special department. The professors should be specialists, and their time and energy should be given to teaching and research. While they may become narrow and incompetent, as suggested by you, it does not seem wise to sacrifice their other work for the purpose of making them broader in their interests and especially at the sacrifice of good administration. I heartily agree with the suggestion of your first item—that is, the election of trustees should be in the hands of a corporation consisting of all persons particularly interested in the welfare of the university. All the educational work of the university should be directed by the president, while all the business interests should be under the control of the treasurer or business manager. For the purpose of expressing the opinions of the educational staff upon all matters connected with the university and for the purpose of drawing the various schools together, there should be a university senate consisting of members elected by the faculties of the various schools, who should give their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page284" title="284"></span>advice to the president and the board of trustees upon all questions presented to them and upon all questions which in their opinion need to be taken up. Such an organization can be made to work with little friction and continuously toward a common purpose, whereas I believe that division of authority and the setting up of almost independent schools would breed internal dissensions and interfere with the progress which the university would otherwise make.</p>

    <p>Your ideas about university control are not mine. I am one of those hopelessly antiquated or reactionary few who believe in the beneficent autocrat theory. That is, as a theory. As a matter of fact I like to have, as a professor, a good deal to say about what this autocrat shall do in relation to the affairs of my own department and interests. At those occasional times when I do not believe in the beneficent autocrat theory I am an extreme democrat. I believe then in the annual or perhaps biennial selection of one of the professors to be president. As we should expect this president to do some special entertaining of visiting guns, I think that his salary should be a little larger than ours; that is, it should be as much larger than ours as the necessities of entertaining entail. Your suggestions as to division of the university into fairly independent schools, or departments, each with its own dean or chairman, appeals to me as wise. I do not believe that the "same salaries should be paid for the same office and the same amount of work." I know what horrible difficulties discrimination in salaries works; but I believe in it just the same. The election of the professors should of course be for life.</p>

    <p>I am in sympathy with the general purpose of your plan, that is, of bringing the faculty into responsibility for all the important acts of the university. Some of the details will hardly work out as universities are. Most universities are at present in a state of formation, in constant struggle for more means and better opportunity. This struggle is ineffective unless there is some recognized leader who has initiative in all forward movements and who can see that the plans for financial expenditure <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page285" title="285"></span>are properly and carefully made. This institution, for example, would have died many times if there had not been somebody responsible day and night, standing between the faculty and litigation intended to take away the university's endowment. As institutions grow older and become less and less of the nature of a "going concern," the need of the president becomes correspondingly less important, although the presidency at its worst seems to me preferable to direction from a political bureau such as exists in Germany. As matters are it would be impossible to pay the president the sum that other professors receive, because his ordinary expenses are twice as great, and the business involves all kinds of worry and risk beyond that of an ordinary professor's chair. I have favored all movements toward having the faculty share the responsibility for policies and for dealing with individaul men. We have developed at Stanford an institution which I think is very good, that of an advisory board of nine full professors, chosen by the academic council without nomination, or suggestion from the president, each one serving for three years, one each from five faculty groups and four chosen at large. Before any appointment, large or small, promotion, removal, or any other matter affecting the policy of the institution, is brought before the board of trustees, the whole matter is laid before this committee for its report and approval. While it does not possess veto power, it is my custom to withdraw all matters to which any considerable objection is made, and it is not hard to find out whether objection will be made beforehand. This brings the faculty of the university into harmony with whatever may be done and it insures that no academic matters will be taken up by the board of trustees as its own initiative, and that the president and board will not spring any surprises on the faculty.</p>

    <p>The years I have spent at one of the smaller universities have not made me feel the need of any radically different organization, for this university at least, so much as the necessity of two things under the present organization: namely, leadership by the president, and contact between the members of the board of trustees and the members of the faculty. The president should be more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page286" title="286"></span>than the efficient agent of trustees and faculties; he should guide the councils of both, informing and advising and inspiring both, so that the opportunities and obligations of the university may be realized and improved. He should never be allowed to become the despot. I believe few presidents wish to become despots, but in their peculiar positions, between a body of academically uninformed men on the one hand and practically uninformed men on the other, they may be forced to become so or to neglect the opportunities of usefulness of the university. This danger of presidential despotism would be lessened if there were added to the present usual organization of American universities another official means of contact between trustees and faculty. No one man can so represent the diversified interests and ideas of two such different masses as trustees and faculties usually are that there will be complete understanding and sympathy, without which the best can not be attained either by or for the university. Being "a country mouse" I find the ways, and the proposed ways, of a city rather terrifying. I judge everything by the smaller standard. So judged, your plan seems to me cumbersome; but the department of which I am a member does not number ten, your minimum, and I can not see that efficiency or, as I prefer to speak of it, usefulness, would be increased by combining into a division a lot of men whose interests are not very similar.</p>

    <p>(l) My personal opinion is that the university will do best with a self-perpetuating board of trustees composed either entirely of laymen or very largely so, who confine their energies as much as possible to business matters. The terms of office should not be too long to allow of a fairly rapid elimination of inactive or otherwise undesirable members. (2) The president should certainly be appointed by the board of trustees, but perhaps on recommendation by the academic council. The academic council might propose three candidates for the choice of the trustees. The president most assuredly should have a larger salary and a more dignified position than the professor. This is purely a matter of supply and demand. Individuals capable of shaping the destinies of a university are few and far between. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page287" title="287"></span>(3) No objection. (4) Each school, division or department should have as complete autonomy as is consistent with the welfare of the university as a whole. It should make nominations for professors (say two or three for each place) to be appointed by the president in consultation with an advisory committee, representatives to which should be elected by the various groups. The salaries must naturally vary according to what is necessary to attract the best men in the various fields. If any group has funds of its own, it naturally should control the expenditure of the same, subject, however, to a certain degree of supervision from the board of trustees. (5) I do not like the idea of a senate, at least not at the present stage of development of American universities.</p>

    <p>The questions proposed in your paper on university control are some of the most difficult that arise in university administration, which just now is in a condition pretty sure to be changed in the near future. In the main, I think your proposals are based on sound principles, but the scheme is a bit complex, and I have some hesitation to see the principle of popular election brought into college administration at all points. There are elements in it which I fear would militate against the highest success in scholarly matters. In the administration of an American university, especially one on private foundation, there are two fields almost, if not quite, independent: one, the management of the financial and material interests of the university; the other, the development and adjustment of the scholarly interests. The financial and material interests of the university are best administered by a board composed in the main of men who have large commercial interests and at the same time have intelligent knowledge of educational matters. The members of such a board should hold office for long terms and should be chosen perhaps by another body representing the educational interests, the choice to be confirmed by the board itself. In purely educational matters I believe in democracy, perhaps in individualism, but in educational administration democracy can not be carried so far as to put aside experience and personal fitness. It must be conceded that some of the rarest scholars have no practical sense in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page288" title="288"></span>educational administration. The president of a university of necessity has a multitude of duties. He is the medium of communication between the body controlling the educational interests and the body controlling the financial and material interests. I do not believe it possible to substitute for him any other officer, such as the chancellor proposed in your article. Your chancellor would represent only the material side of the university, and the president representing the educational side would be subordinate. I believe the best president to be one who has come up through the educational work, who has held a preeminent place in educational or scientific circles, and has shown practical skill and balance in the adjustment of educational matters. He must be able to appreciate scholarship, though he may not himself be a great scholar. He must be able to present educational matters in such a way as to convince a board whose chief concern is financial and material. I believe that the best president will be secured from the educational ranks of the institution which he is to administer. You will note from these statements that I am not out of sorts with existing conditions. The plan of administration in an American university is in my judgment not subject to severe criticism. The defects are in the men who are selected as university administrators. Perhaps this implies a defect in the plan of selection, but I do not believe that it necessitates a complete readjustment. If, for instance, some method could be devised for the nomination of presidential possibilities by the educational body, may be when there is no presidential vacancy, and the board of trustees could then make a selection from these nominations, many existing difficulties would be gotten out of the way. Assuming that deans and presidents have no legislative functions, but purely administrative, I am not sure that they should be subject solely to selection by the educational body. Personal qualifications count for so much in these administrative offices that election by an outside body on the nomination of the educational body gives, I think, the best results. Surely administrative officers must be given some added compensation for increased expense of living and for sacrifice in scientific preferment. A very great deal could be gained by giving the various schools of the university greater autonomy. Each school knows <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page289" title="289"></span>its own problems, and the men in these schools are chosen with special reference to the work of that school. Within the school everything should be as democratic as possible. The department head should be largely done away with, especially in departments of five men or more. There should be frequent meetings of the members of a department, and most matters should be decided by vote, recognizing, of course, that senior members there as everywhere will have a preponderating influence. Your proposed method of promotion and of the election of professors is, I think, admirable. If a professorship in a given department becomes vacant I am inclined to think that there should be associated with the president and dean of the school for the selection of a successor at least three professors in departments not too closely allied. The choice of instructors in a given department may well be left to the senior members of the department, subject to confirmation by the dean or president. In university administration two things must be guarded against: autocracy, on the one hand, and the control of educational matters by boards or by individuals who are not thoroughly conversant with them from practical experience; and, on the other hand, government by prejudice and preferment, rather than by reason and adaptability.</p>

    <p>I am sure that reforms are needed, but they must come gradually. If you or I had the organization of a brand-new ten-million-dollar university, we might get forward a little. But would you or I not want to be sometimes a little autocratic?</p>

    <p>The evolution of future schemes of administration should approximate some organization like the one you outline. In taking away the autocratic power of a president, there is danger of going too far and of reducing the office to one which no man of force and ability would care to assume. In that case the institution would suffer for lack of efficient leadership.</p>

    <p>In common with most university professors, I believe that modifications of existing conditions are desirable; at the same time my ideas of specific measures are not stable. I am favorable to the formation of a corporation as suggested in section (1) of your paper—also I find the considerations in footnotes (7), <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page290" title="290"></span>(8) and (9) especially commendable. I think I see advantages in maintaining the office of president in university organization on the present plane, but a new method of selecting the executive and the evolution of a new type of university president seems to me of importance. The nomination of president should come from the professors, as suggested in your section (2), since these men have better knowledge of the generic qualities required and have sources of information regarding candidates for the position not often made use of by boards of trustees. The coordination of the general interests of various departments of the university, and the devising of measures for general development, need the unremitting attention of one man. The president should have a cabinet of advisers composed of representatives of the various departments of the university, and his recommendations to the trustees should have the approval of this cabinet. The thing that I fear most in a very general participation by the professors in questions of development is excess of machinery and the distracting of some capable men from lines of productive scholarship. I believe that higher value should be attached by president and trustees to the products of ripe scholarship, and that they should undertake to determine the conditions under which contributions to knowledge can be made, and to provide the essentials for this form of university activity. In the universities with which I am best acquainted there is a constant warring of interests. The men who show initiative and trained powers of analysis are drafted for onerous committee work and for administrative positions to the detriment of their productive scholarship. A more altruistic executive, who places higher value on the results of scholarship and is disposed to conserve the powers of members of his faculty by providing opportunities, is much needed in our universities.</p>

    <p>I believe we can get farthest if we hold fast to one elemental principle, namely, that the faculty are the essential part of the university. (The students may be left out of consideration here, since they take no part in the management.) All other elements are extraneous. They are useful only in so far as they aid the faculty; and they become detrimental when they in any way <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page291" title="291"></span>hinder the faculty. If this principle is taken as the guide, one can never go far wrong. The details of administration must vary according to circumstances and no single plan will in its details meet all the different conditions which arise in times of progress—but the principle of faculty control can be made to hold throughout. In regard to this, we are in complete agreement. The details, as I said, can not be generalized to meet all conditions, but the following are the fruit of my personal experience and observation. (1) I do not believe in giving any authority to the alumni—though they should be encouraged to give advice. My experience is that the alumni, after they leave the university, do not keep sufficiently in touch with the university problems to make it safe to entrust any power to them. In short, I see no need for the "corporation"—and what is not needed is apt to be harmful. (2) The president should be nominated by the faculties or their representatives. It should be his duty to carry through the policies of the university (<i>i. e.</i>, of the faculties); and his main responsibility should be to them, rather than to the trustees. This power would naturally be greater than that of any individual professor, but less than that of the professorial majority. Salary is a question of demand and supply of that particular type of talent. An executive officer of this type is needed to give effective execution to faculty counsels. If this is understood to be his function, autocracy would be a breach of trust, unfitting the man for the office. Tenure of office, otherwise, depends upon circumstances. In the present progressive era permanent tenure is almost necessary. (3), (4) No criticism, except as to salaries. A salary schedule uniform, for a given grade, is not feasible at present. Nor do I consider it desirable. There should be an established scale of "normal" salaries, but exceptions should be permissible. (5) Trustees: These should fulfill two functions: (1) financial agents; (2) balance wheel; in this latter function they should have a veto power on all nominations and on all important matters of policy; but they should not have the power of initiative in either direction.</p>

    <p>I have long felt that college education can better be secured through rather small colleges than through institutions whose <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page292" title="292"></span>students number thousands. I recognize that greater expense is involved, but I feel very sure that the better result is worth the added cost. Your very interesting article on "University Control" seems to me strongly-to suggest that university education can, on the whole, better be provided through institutions smaller than the largest of our present universities. The difficulties of administration which your article emphasizes are not inherent in the university, but in large size and complexity. The Johns Hopkins University is able to have, as Oberlin College has, faculty government in all matters of internal administration, and each member of the faculty is able fairly well to grasp the problems of the whole university. This produces a harmony of feeling and administration, and an intelligent cooperation, such as could not be secured, I think, by your plan. I have little criticism to offer of your plan as applied to institutions of very large size. My criticism is rather more fundamental. I do not believe that it is possible to secure the very finest results in university education in institutions so large that they will need to adopt the plan which you advocate. Semi-autonomy of the different departments of the institution, with intelligent cooperation of all officers and instructors in the common work of the whole institution, will, I believe, work out better than more complete autonomy and representative government. May I ask how the corporation would be chosen? I doubt the value in America of a chancellor. I do not feel much sympathy with the tendency of American schools to emphasize pageantry in connection with their public functions, and I see little use for a chancellor in any other connection. I believe a president chosen by the trustees upon nomination of the faculty to be a valuable factor in the American college or university. He has great expense in entertaining and in many ways, as the official representative of the institution, and he should, I think, on this account more than on any other, have a salary much larger than that of the professors. It does not reach the needs of the case for him to have a fund upon which he can draw for entertainment and other such expenses, for this would interfere with the personal character of these courtesies which he may extend, and would make them official. President ----- has done a great deal to serve the institution by personally <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page293" title="293"></span>entertaining at his home the officers of college classes and student organizations. He has positively refused to allow the college to bear any share of the expense involved, lest it make these relations official rather than personal. I believe his judgment is good. You advocate a university of the German type with the several institutes completely autonomous. I like somewhat better a larger cooperation between departments than the German university presents. I believe that the election of the department head and executive committee by the department faculty would work advantageously, such election to be confirmed by a university council to consist of all the full professors. I cordially approve the method of nomination and election of professors which you suggest. It is that in vogue in the Hopkins University and in Oberlin. On electing to professorships men who have not already been tried in a similar capacity in the institution in which they are to serve, I believe in general that the election should be first for a definite term of years (not too long), the election to be made permanent by regular vote at the completion of this term, if all is mutually satisfactory. Of course, in calling a man of highly approved ability, this may often not be necessary. But I believe in the wisdom of choosing often younger men of great promise, and advancing them as they prove their complete fitness. Doubtless you do not intend to advocate financial autonomy except in the expenditure of income; its investment should be in the hands of the trustees. I believe more cordially in general university endowments whose income shall be distributed to the several departments as the university senate shall advise, rather than in an elaborate series of endowments for separate departments. The greatest flexibility in this regard will enable the institution to accommodate itself from generation to generation to the changing needs of the community which it serves. I do not, therefore, approve your suggestion in the last sentence of paragraph (4). Finally, let me suggest that there should be such organization and also such atmosphere in the whole institution as will tend to encourage initiative in each member of the institution, initiative not only in the matters committed particularly to him, or to the department to which he belongs, or to the committee of which he is a member, but every-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page294" title="294"></span>thing should tend to provoke suggestions in regard to all university problems from each member of the university community. Your proposed semi-disintegration of the universities into autonomous departments would, I think, seriously interfere with this incentive to initiative. This is one of several reasons why a smaller institution with the New England town-meeting plan of government will achieve results not obtainable by the very large institution which, because of its very size, must have representative government.</p>

    <p>Considered as an ideal scheme I find myself in general agreement with your plan of university control. The fundamental feature of the whole plan is the proposition to make the university corporation the final source of power, the trustees, as well as faculty members, to be elected from and by the corporation. To most of us, at first sight, such a plan appears revolutionary in the extreme, but it is not absolutely new. I know of several schools in the United States where the plan has been tried, and in which the college, as the corporation was called, was constituted of professors, alumni and other individuals in sympathy with the work of the institutions. In one case, at least, this form of corporate management has been successful, but in another case it failed miserably after some twenty-five years of trial, and the cause of failure was found in the growth of the corporation through the addition of alumni to the point where the whole body broke up into factions on questions of policy. All this trouble, however, might have been easily avoided by a slight change in the form of incorporation. I am thoroughly in sympathy with the idea of making the president a faculty selection, and of divorcing his office from the work of securing funds for the support of the university. What a sorry figure some of our state university presidents present when they descend each year to the business of lobbying with the state legislature! As the president should be selected by the faculty, or rather by the senate of the faculties, so the head of each department should be the choice of the departmental faculty. But the executive committee of this faculty should be partly elective and partly appointive. I believe, for certain practical reasons, the president of the univer-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page295" title="295"></span>sity should have the appointment of half the members on this governing committee. Having this right of appointment, the president is better able to keep in touch with the work of each faculty. While each college or department of a university should have a large measure of autonomy, this departmental independence should, in a degree, be limited by the control of a university senate, made up of members elected from each faculty. I am of the opinion that to the senate might be left certain functions which you suggest should be lodged with the trustees—for example, the filling of the higher grades of professorships. The advice of the president, as the educational head of the university, should naturally carry great weight here, but should not, necessarily, be final. On the senate should devolve the work of bringing all the departments of the university up to the same grade or level of efficiency. A good law school, for illustration, should have some way of insisting that the weaker medical or engineering department of the university should be strengthened, and the senate would probably be the best agency to accomplish the end desired. All standards of expenditure in universities are undergoing such rapid changes that the financial side of university management overshadows all others. Chairs must be established to keep pace with the developments in new fields and often there is the keenest kind of competition to secure men to fill certain special positions. The marked raising of salaries in some directions is a consequence, and much worry and jealousy result because all salaries for equal work can not be brought up at the same time. The principle is just but the practise is hard to reach, and until we can find a better system of managing the financial affairs of our universities it seems too much to hope for a more rational scheme of general control and a democratic adjustment of salaries and conditions of work</p>

    <p>(1) I am not quite sure of the effective interest of such a corporation. I am a trustee of a large boys' school, managed in just this way, by a large corporation who elect the board of trustees The corporation as individuals have a strong interest in the school, but in my twenty years of connection with it I do not remember any policy initiated by its members, except so far as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page296" title="296"></span>they took care to elect an effective board of trustees. (2) I am not sure that a man who has expert knowledge of education and of university administration would be willing to take a presidency under the conditions suggested. Administration implies power. The chief difficulty, however, is the financial one. In most institutions in this country the president raises the funds for all improvements or advancement. This is largely true, even in the state universities. If the financial condition were as it is in Germany, the faculty-elected president would surely be the desirable one. All that you say in footnote 3 of the difficulties of the present system is true, and so far as I can see they are likely to become yet more troublesome before they are abated. (3) I heartily agree to all this, but think that department faculty meetings of considerably more than twenty members may be made efficient if most of the material for deliberation is prepared by committees. (4) I think the method described is a good method, which might, however, be indefinitely varied in its details. (5) I think of this as of (4).</p>

    <p>Your general plan to put university control in the hands of men who are especially qualified by education, experience and interest to exercise such control—or in the hands of persons elected by such men—meets with my hearty approval. Any reasonable plan which will take from presidents of autocratic nature and from trustees, who are not educational experts, the decision in matters educational will make for good. To my mind the greatest present danger to individual universities, and to higher education in general, comes from such presidents and trustees. With some of the details of the proposed plan I do not always find myself in accord. (1) This article with the exception of the chancellor meets with my approval. I should be inclined to omit this office or combine it with that of president. (2) The first sentence is to my mind excellent, but with the second I do not agree. All groups of men, to be fully efficient, must have leaders and each group a leader. Such a leader in an educational institution should be the president, and a good president must be a large man—a man who is a real leader. Such a man deserves a large salary, a more dignified position and larger <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page297" title="297"></span>powers than a professor, but he should not have powers, as is now often the case,- larger than all the professors. University professors need some leadership, even in an educational democracy, and in order to have an efficient leader I see no way but to make his office better paid, of more dignity and of more power than that of the professor. (3) With this item I agree provided the unit does not become too limited, <i>i. e.</i>, the school of medicine should be a unit and not the department of chemistry in the school of medicine, even if that department should in size be larger than "is prescribed by a psychological constant." (4) This article is good, with the exception of the part relating to financial autonomy. I do not regard financial autonomy as necessary or even essential to the different schools or departments of a great university; in fact I doubt if these departments should have complete financial autonomy. The final word concerning finances should rest in a higher body—such as the senate or the trustees, or better in both,—rather than in a division of the university. (5) This article meets with my approval. I trust that this discussion you are undertaking may be productive of much good and that its results may soon be felt in the evolution of the ideal method of university control.</p>

    <p>I heartily agree with the general features of your plan. Personally I have not suffered from any autocratic supervision. The university authorities have allowed me to go my own way. I think this was perhaps because from the first I insisted upon it that I should be permitted to do about as I thought best in the planning of my own work. At one time I offered to compromise matters by writing my resignation. The fact is, however, that university management is too autocratic. The strong men are avoiding such work. I do think, however, that when a strong man who is capable of doing the work of a scholar is asked to give his life to executive drudgery, he is being asked to make a great sacrifice. He finally sinks into the unknown with nothing left behind him to represent a lifetime of work. He may hold his head above that of the ordinary professor, as the man of business does. That is, however, only while he holds his position, or while he is alive. If he is great only because he has been <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page298" title="298"></span>appointed to a position with a larger salary, he makes a pitiful showing. It counts for nothing when he is gone. If a university could have a business manager, and the faculty could have an executive who is one of them, and who might serve them temporarily, to be replaced by another by vote of the faculty, it would be an ideal arrangement. At the same time I must say that I should not like to be asked to sacrifice my time in that way. The trouble with our present plan is that there are few men, very few men, who are fitted for such a position. It is too lofty. If the position were made less autocratic and more nearly on a level with that of the average professor, we might find men who could fill the place without finding it necessary to swell out their lungs and to bend their vertebral columns backwards.</p>

    <p>I heartily endorse your proposed plan for university control in principle. There are one or two matters, in connection with the administration of schools or divisions, which I think might be improved. I do not believe that there should be an executive committee for each school or division, but in place of it there should be a faculty composed of about twenty members and officered by a dean or secretary. The officers should be subject to annual reappointment. With a permanent dean and an executive committee the rearrangement of the school is very apt to become one-sided. The faculty should be composed of representatives from every department in the school, in proportion to the relative size and importance of the department, and it should elect temporary committees as required for every question that can not be properly debated and adjudicated by the faculty without further investigation. Such committees would report back to the faculty for action. The president of the university should be <i>ex officio</i> chairman of the faculties. Instead of nominations for professorships coming from the faculty, they should, I think, come in the first place from a board of advisers. After the nominations have been made, others from the faculty might be added. The faculty choice should be subject to veto of trustees, etc., only where any good cause for such veto is shown to exist.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page299" title="299"></span>I fully and thoroughly agree with the spirit of the proposed reform. If our universities are to exercise the function for which they have been created, if we do not wish to see them stifle thought, freedom and all the elements which made them the leaders in the moral and intellectual life of nations, then some such reform as that suggested in the proposed plan seems an absolute necessity.</p>

    <p>The plan of organization of our universities meets with my most hearty approval. I have considered the matter seriously and it appears to be the most feasible one I have known to be advocated.</p>

    <p>I am heartily in sympathy with the general position taken by you consistently with regard to the problem of university administration. Even the small college feels the tendency to depart from democratic methods in the handling of college affairs. I find nothing in the suggestions made by you that I should criticize adversely. I hope that you will keep up the fight for the greater responsibility and dignity of the professorial office. Those of my colleagues with whom I have discussed the matter heartily approve your plan to reorganize university control on a representative basis.</p>

    <p>The autocracy of the president here being absolute, you can guess how incompetent the faculty. How gladly would the poor humiliated wretches welcome your sections (1) and (2). There is of course nothing like permanence of tenure. There is no elective participation in anything. I have always recognized, and now more forcibly than ever, the necessity of something corresponding to your sections (4) and (5). "No president is desirable other than an annually elected rector."</p>

    <p>I presume your letter sent me has reference only to the larger educational institutions of the country—the real universities—rather than the small colleges (some of them calling themselves universities) of which there are but too many. The average salary, training, specialized efficiency and broadness of view of the members of the faculties of these smaller schools especially <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page300" title="300"></span>is of so low a grade that I think "a one-man court" of final appeal is absolutely necessary, namely, a president, selected because of his broader grasp of educational problems, general fitness as a leader, and advisably with previous training as a teacher, whose salary should be deservedly somewhat larger, whose position should be more dignified, and whose powers should be greater than those of a professor. His entire faculty is often not much larger than that of a department in one of the larger institutions and thus he can easily confer with its ranking members in the consideration of problems of policy. I think to avoid the evil and confusion of mixed policies there should be some one man in the small school whose word is final. In all purely school matters his word should be practically final to even his board of trustees by whom he is appointed. The trustees of such a school should be chosen, probably best self-perpetuatingly, chiefly from among its alumni, and should comprise the most successful business men of that body with a few of its most efficient lawyers and certainly some intelligent physicians. Their distinctive duties should be to solicit, collect, guard and administer the resources of the school, always advising with the president as to the allotment of its income. For the larger schools, the actual universities, say those with a total faculty of more than 75, with more than 15 necessarily separate departments and with a graduate department meriting the name, I agree with your proposals, including the footnotes, with the following suggestions: (1) If a president be chosen for the larger institution, he usually does little or no teaching and of course should be fitted and logically expected to perform the duties assigned to a chancellor. (2) A most excellent method for the selection of a president. However, I think there should be an especially chosen small committee of the trustees, interested outsiders, which should especially aid in the investigation of the general fitness of the candidates and that the members of this committee should have equal voting powers with the "professors or officers" mentioned. Often the faculty member is wofully ignorant of or lax in investigating the private character and practical fitness of a candidate, especially one in a distant institution or state. How would it do to let the "professors or officers" here constitute the "senate" <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page301" title="301"></span>of paragraph (5)? Further, just as the deans of divisions are given an additional dignity (expressed in additional salary) for performing the duties of dean, so, I think, the office of president will carry additional dignity always. He must at least perform the duties of head dean, he must or should be considered chairman of all the general committees of the faculty, of the general plenums and of the senate, and should thus have the deciding vote in cases of tie-votes. To this extent his powers are greater than those of the professor. (4) This I think a most admirable and safe plan. To be more specific, I think the sentence beginning in line 11 of the paragraph should be changed to read, "The election of professors and heads of departments in a division, if such heads be recognized, should be for life, etc." (5) It is suggested that the "senate" here consist of the "professors" of (2), and that the senate be assigned the additional duty of choosing the president, voting coordinately with a special committee of the trustees, always much smaller than the senate.</p>

    <p>The present condition of affairs in our leading universities is well-nigh intolerable, and little calculated to attract men of the highest ability to a university career. The plan you propose sounds as though it would work well. In some of its aspects I have seen it in very successful operation at the St. Louis University. In that institution (as I believe is customary in Roman Catholic universities) the president is known as "rector" and the office is but little elevated above that of professor. The medical department (of which I speak particularly, as I was formerly on its teaching staff and had a good opportunity to study its methods) has complete autonomy in everything except its finances. The medical faculty, being composed of physicians in practise who give clinical instruction only, was found to be too large and unwieldy a body to handle the many difficult and complicated questions that inevitably arise in the instruction and discipline of a large body of students. Hence there was organized the junior council, composed of the men of professorial rank in the fundamental branches of medicine and presided over by the rector, or in his absence by the dean of the school. These men, being all professional teachers and giving their entire time <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page302" title="302"></span>to teaching, were naturally best fitted to handle all matters pertaining to their own and closely related departments, and this fact was given full recognition. In no instance were the recommendations of this body slighted or ignored. Few, if any, departments or schools of a university have such need of a governing body of this sort as a medical school. Usually all the professors of the department can be brought together at frequent intervals for full, free and candid discussion of all measures which concern the department, but this is not possible for a medical school. To use a homely simile, the junior council is the tail that wags the dog. However it is to be accomplished, let us get away from the autocratic type of university government! It is a blot on American education which can not too soon be removed. Perhaps, as you suggest, it can not be done suddenly. I presume a gradual curtailment of the power of the president, with corresponding increase of the power of the faculty, and more careful selection of trustees, is what you have in mind. I agree heartily with your scheme of representative government in universities and wonder why it has not been adopted long since.</p>

    <p>I do not agree wholly with everything said, but I believe the plan of control proposed would work many improvements and also that your scheme offers a number of useful points for discussion. I fear your picture of the faculty meetings in the old days is too good to be true, or, if such a happy time existed, it was due more to indolence and lack of interest than to a spirit of cooperation and loyalty. In other words, I do not believe that faculties at present are any worse than of old, but that the greater complexity of administration and the greater activity of discussion regarding methods, are chiefly responsible for the present condition. (1) The proposed corporation would be useful just to the extent in which the members took a genuine interest in the institution. Your footnote (3) shows some of the weak points that exist now. "Would they be eliminated by changing the scheme, or is not a deeper change necessary? (2) I think the plan is a good one, but the question may be raised whether men could be obtained to fill the position at present, under conditions named. The proposal, at any rate, is more likely to be practicable in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page303" title="303"></span>future than it is at present. The footnote showing the possibility of an annually elected rector is interesting in this connection. When our schools have all their details as thoroughly worked out as they are in Germany the duties of the president will be much less onerous than they are now and the plan would have many advantages. (3) The suggestions here are very good, particularly those in regard to frequent meetings and daily intercourse. The essential thing is to have groups having common objects and interests, to understand the whole and feel responsible for it. Your plan for electing professors does not seem to ensure the broad sympathy for other departments, the minimum of selfishness that works night and day to enhance its own department regardless of others or of the institution, and the widespread indifference to responsibility that is so conspicuous all through our social and political life. (4) This also is very good, although it hardly seems necessary to have the final vote for professorships by the university senate. You say the same salary should be paid for the same office and the same amount of work. This does not seem to mean so much when we consider its application. The same office does not and can not call for the same amount of work, besides the kind of work varies so that the individual factor will always exist when salaries are under discussion. (5) Very good and should be easy to bring about, but in practise at present fails on account of some of the causes mentioned under (3).</p>

    <p>"We have reached a stage of experience where it is possible, as well as necessary, so to adjust duties and officers as to secure a democratic, scientific mechanism, which will do the work and upbuild it. There would then be some chance for a healthy growth, a natural development of departments and their mutual cooperation for the welfare and influence of the institution. Individualism would love to work through a sane mechanism. But I realize the force of your footnote (1), "no sensible person would attempt to reform suddenly by a paper constitution a system which has developed in response to its environment." This characterizes the problem of the medical school, which is remodeling. As you say "The boss, the university president, etc., have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page304" title="304"></span>conduced to a certain kind of efficiency and to an enlargement more rapid than would otherwise have been possible." In case of a medical school brought under the university by a sudden coup —"what the community (faculty) does is dependent upon the men who compose it," etc.—certainly, but as many of them are inexperienced as educators, an autocratic leader may be needed to get them started and bring in outside men to make the metamorphosis real. The time soon comes, however, when this spells non-progression and the organization must be made democratic. Then you find that the ideal plan must be yet postponed for a while. When a faculty is accustomed to vote individually on everything it is difficult for an advocate of your plan to get them to vote through representatives. They insist on open, general faculty discussion and voting on all points. Your scheme means departmental organization, and requires the faculty to think in groups for the whole. It fixes more responsibilities on the groups and decentralizes in that sense; yet it requires a centripetal cooperativeness, as it were, which means more work and thought for each. Undoubtedly it would greatly develop the faculty and raise the standard. It would broaden and strengthen the individuals of the group; but it is difficult for them to give up easier and more direct functions for the more scientific and effective method. I have recently seen certain parts of your plan brought up for adoption in a faculty and rejected for these reasons. It was claimed that professors must not be even nominated by the faculty because of dangers of political intrigues—your wider nominating committee, however, would have met this objection. The same objection was offered to faculty election of dean. This was a confession of weakness by the faculty. Departments were not trusted to elect representatives for committees for common faculty action, because the faculty at large was regarded as far better fitted to select from the members of a department the best man for a committee. Of course the objectors were individualists of such an extreme type, produced in the general faculty meetings, that they could not see the necessity of even a limited subordination of the individual for cooperative action. The professor is so impressed with the personal privilege, etc., of autocracy that he imitates the president in miniature. If <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page305" title="305"></span>the professors of our larger departments would place their subordinates more on a par with themselves, would organize so as to divide responsibilities and privileges with the staff, much greater efficiency would appear in departments (the various members of the staff should be encouraged to offer views, take responsibilities), and the method would be found to apply well to cooperation between departments.</p>
