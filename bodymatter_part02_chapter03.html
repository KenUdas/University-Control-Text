    <h2 class="calibre9">III. Letters from Columbia University</h2>

    <p>I have very little confidence in the administration of a university by a corporation or senate to represent either the alumni, or the teaching staff, or a mixture. In spite of the notable evils of one-man power, I prefer it. The one man, however, should be responsible to the community at large. Private institutions should be regulated by the state and owned and controlled by the state as soon as may be. I do believe in the partial control of its own finances by each division or school, meaning thereby an administrative unit of from ten to twenty professors. The one man in power should give the control of certain capital funds and of certain current receipts to such a division, holding them responsible for the results. I do not believe in the sharp separation of a group of professors to form a higher educational caste with a group of instructors and lecturers separated from them by a sharp gap. Perhaps you, too, do not intend that. I should have much confidence in mere publicity with respect to all these matters of administration. If the exact budget, the exact work done by each member of the teaching staff and the full reports of the debates of all trustee and faculty meetings were made entirely public, I should expect very good results.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that in the present development of universities in this country, we are, of necessity, in the state of one-man control, and I doubt if we are ready to get out of it. Certainly I should feel that it was dangerous during the period of building up institutions to resort to any policy that would give only a temporary head. It seems to me that our safety lies in the check of publicity during this period through which we are passing.</p>

    <p>I should assent to your propositions (1), (3) and (5) without change. I should modify (2) by giving the president a higher salary—you yourself suggest this in the footnote (8). It is a most difficult and complicated task and requires a man of first-rate ability. On the whole I agree to (4), except that I dissent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page93" title="93"></span> entirely from the lock-step salary. There should be a standard salary; but the university should always be free to pay higher salaries to men of higher abilities or distinction—as you, again, recognize in footnote (8). Competition for a comparatively small number of highly priced research professorships should operate as a great spur to the higher class of activity. I believe, however, that this introduces more difficulties in the way of nominating professors by vote of the department; and this plan has also disadvantages—for instance, the difficulty of introducing fresh blood or new lines of work into a department that has got into a rut. Frankly I don't know what is the best way to nominate professors; this is a difficult problem—perhaps the most difficult one, as I view the matter. Human nature being what it is, democracy in such matters tends, I fear, to mediocrity. On the whole I am not averse to benevolent despotism in such matters; but how shall we make sure of the benevolence?</p>

    <p>No form of university control can be permanently defensible unless it makes for "the slow growth of traditions" and for "security, permanence and honor." Presidential autocracy is favorable to efficiency of a certain type, but in its extreme form —that in which a president has the authority, even if he has not the character of tyrant—is incompatible with the highest conception of a university, and the existence of such an authority could not fail to be offensive to any man of spirit and especially to the finer sensibilities of any genuine university professor. Democracy, whether or not it be "a conspiracy of the weak against the strong," is, as you say, impossible. Is the principle of representation adequate? If not, is it the best? I do not know. One danger of it is that it tends to foster cliques, "kitchen politics" now infecting the larger German universities, and may lead to practical oligarchy, which may be defined as a conspiracy of the strong or the unscrupulous against the weak or the scrupulous. As between an autocratic tyrant and an oligarchic tyrant the former is probably preferable, for in that case one knows against whom to level the rifle of objurgation. It would be interesting to know whether American university professors complain more of autocracy than German university professors do of "kitchen<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page94" title="94"></span> politics." I doubt whether all professors (of given length of service) should receive the same salary. A body of professors being selected with all possible care, they will present very great, almost infinite, differences in respect to character, ability, genius —worth. Such differences ought, it would seem, to be in some measure reflected in their salaries.</p>

    <p>I believe that an institution organized on the basis proposed would discharge the functions of the university in the best possible way, but the existing personnel of American universities might not at once adapt itself thereto. Such details have suggested themselves to me as that the plan for selecting the members to the corporation should perhaps be so construed as not to include those members of the teaching staff whose affiliations with the university were apt to be more or less temporary. It is surely a most regrettable consequence of the present administrative system that the higher a man rises in grade the more administrative duties he has to distract him from the work he has shown special fitness to do. The plan of having an executive secretary for each division or department might be examined to advantage. It is not clear to me how the matter of control of the funds would be met; i. e., how there would be determined the amount to be allotted for various purposes to the different departments. It would seem very difficult to avoid centralization here, with the natural powers it gives. The proper conception of the university renders its efficiency less dependent upon governmental system than upon the men who live under it. That governmental system is best, therefore, which attracts and maintains at the university the men most efficient for it, i. e., the men of the greatest intellect and independence therein. Other things being equal, such men are likely to be most attracted to the institution that offers the greatest possible autonomy to groups having common interests, at the same time preserving the sense of solidarity with other constituent groups. Some scheme for cooperative control is doubtless the end to be sought.</p>

    <p>Let me say that I am so happy and contented in being detached from the present system that I am loath to disturb my serenity <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page95" title="95"></span> by serious thinking and comment on your proposals, alluring as, offhand, they seem.</p>

    <p>I am convinced that the present system is not the best one. I should be glad to see your plan put into operation if it could be done gradually.</p>

    <p>Your scheme of organization for the larger universities seems to me a most excellent one.</p>

    <p>I am very much in favor of the changes which you suggest; in fact, unless some changes are made soon, the entire university system as such will go to pieces.</p>

    <p>In the matter of your recommendations for the carrying on of the "political" work of a university I am cordially sympathetic, but never in the great world will so discursive a set of people get together in so many diverse lines! In the nature of things I for one am convinced that we are bound in the direction of a benevolent despotism! The purse strings are after all the ultima ratio in governing a university, and the people who are in the class of wealthy trustees and Carnegian benefactors will ever want to see that some of "their men" are placed in positions of governing. So the professors will ever be employees (having more or less dignity or consideration). Alas, that I should be led to think that their powers will not include election of the president. . . . I am inclined to picture such a state as <i>non collegium sed utopia</i>. But we can at least hope and strive for the best.</p>

    <p>Your proposed plan of university control seems to me admirable. "We are just now passing through an era of autocratic government which is probably a necessary stage of development and justified by its immediate fruits. But in the long run our universities can only secure men of the highest character and ability by giving them a controlling interest in its policies. These should be determined by the faculties, who should be made independent of trustees or president. The present order of things is an inversion, based on commercial usage. The logical result ought to be much worse than the actual experience shows. Still the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page96" title="96"></span>contemptuous references to mere faculties and professors rather frequently emitted by some of our university magnates are not likely to impress the public with respect for our higher institutions of learning. Some of our university boards of trustees are already leavened with alumni representatives. Harvard has long had its board of overseers, a check on the autocratic powers of the corporation. Perhaps the general problem may find in this direction a gradual solution. Corporate bodies of large wealth are hard to abolish, but it is possible to trim their autocratic powers.</p>

    <p>As a whole, your plan seems to me to be an excellent one. It would appear to me to be making for the closest possible union of those who should and would be normally interested in the welfare of the university. The one specific suggestion which I should like to make would be that the selection of the president be made on a plan resembling that followed by German universities, viz., that a rector be chosen for the term of one or two years from among the members of the different faculties. The only criticism which I would make of your article is the use of the term "complete anarchy" in your last sentence. This term I am afraid may be misunderstood readily, or, at least, understood in a sense different from what you probably intend to have it convey.</p>

    <p>I am heartily in sympathy with most of the points which you make, and I firmly believe that they would do much to improve the condition of our university work and especially to rid us of the element of commercialism which now takes so much time and energy for many good men. I am not so sure about the minor points relating to financial autonomy of divisions, because I think of cases of departments which have been fostered by the university, but which would have suffered from lack of financial support if run on an independent basis. With regard to the term of office of a president, it seems to me that the annually elected rector of the German universities does not have time enough to get in touch with his duties and so it seems to me that a longer period would be desirable. For example, many Ameri-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page97" title="94"></span>can universities have deans who serve a long term of years and without bringing upon their office the criticism so often brought upon American college presidents.</p>

    <p>The present system of governing universities is wrong, utterly and completely, and is rapidly tending to lower and degrade the standard of the university and of the individual professor. Unless the university is to become a trade school and the professor a factory boss, the system must be changed, and the University must be put on a representative basis of government. So much is clear, but it is not easy to formulate a new system which will stand the test of experience. The general proposition outlined in your circular appears fairly satisfactory, but I think there are some points which might be modified to advantage. (1) The trustees should serve for stated terms and should be divided into classes, so as to be representative of the different classes of society; a certain number should be educators, others professional men (doctors, lawyers, engineers), others business men (bankers, merchants and manufacturers). (2) The president should be nominated by the professors or officers but elected by the trustees. He should serve for a stated period. His salary, however, would of necessity be larger than that of a professor, as he would be called upon for larger expenditures in the way of entertaining, travel, etc. (4) The election of a professor should be for a stated term, not for life. He should devote his entire time and energy during the academic year to university work, and should forfeit his position if, during the academic year, he did any outside work for pay. I do not believe life tenure is best. Any man is apt to let down in his work if he feels that his position is absolutely secure for life. With proper administrative reforms and the elimination of outside work, the salaries of professors should be greatly raised. The head of a large department should receive at least $10,000; junior professors, $6,000 to $8,000. On the low salaries received to-day no man can live in comfort; hence the present necessity of adding to the salary by outside work. This outside work detracts from the efficiency of the professor, and his small efficiency tends to lower his salary. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page98" title="98"></span> High salaries, prohibition of outside work for pay and increased dignity of position are needed. I believe that high salaries with increased efficiency would be found economical. On the whole, I believe that your general plan would meet many of the difficulties now encountered in university life, and that it offers a very fair basis for working out the problem of university control.</p>
