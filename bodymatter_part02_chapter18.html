    <h2 class="calibre9">XVIII. Anonymous Letters</h2>

    <p>The test of any plan of organization is its efficiency in securing the best qualified man (<i>i. e.</i>, the expert) to perform each function. In the college or university there are three main groups of functions: First: To use your words, "The representation of the common sense ... of the community in university policy." Second: Administration. Third: Teaching and research. In seeking to determine the best methods of organization for the performance of these functions it should be borne in mind, as pointed out by President David Starr Jordan that, for a true university, doing only graduate work, a much simpler organization and looser administration may suffice than is necessary in a college dealing with undergraduate students and in which the work of the departments and schools must be definitely coordinated. Much confusion of thought has arisen from failure to define the term university. For the average American "university," a considerable degree of centralization is necessary. From this point of view I offer the following comments: <i>First:</i> The university, whether state or endowed, exists for the benefit of the whole people, and they and not any selected body should constitute the corporation and select the trustees. The present boards of the state universities seem to me on the whole fairly well adapted to perform their function, and even the boards of endowed institutions are to a considerable degree responsive to public opinion. <i>Second:</i> Expert administration is of equally vital concern to the trustees and to the faculty (the full professors, elected for life). Both should therefore participate in the selection of major administrative officers upon some plan which distinctly recognizes their mutual interest. Probably a scheme based on nomination by the faculty of the university or of the school (either acting directly or through an academic senate or an executive committee) and election by the trustees would be the most feasible. These officers should appoint their own subordinates in administration and be responsible for them. There <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page307" title="307"></span>should not be a separate executive or chancellor of the board of trustees. The university is one and should be represented in all its relations by a single executive head. The major administrative positions should be equal in dignity to professorships and election should, therefore, be for the same term. The salaries paid must of necessity recognize the comparative rarity of first-rate administrative ability. There should be a large measure of autonomy on the part of schools, divisions, etc., and much liberty as to details of organization and procedure. <i>Third:</i> The establishment of chairs and the selection of professors are questions which concern both the faculty and the administrative officers and both should participate in their decision, subject to the veto of the trustees. Some such scheme of nomination as you suggest seems both feasible and desirable, but the approval of the nominations by the dean or the president, or both, should be required. In practise, I think the initiative is likely to fall naturally into the hands of the administrative officers.</p>

    <p>I can only speak from the acquaintance I have had with state educational institutions. Taking up the matter according to your subdivisions: (1) I agree fully with you, certainly the alumni should be sufficiently interested to join the corporation in order to have voting power. It would hardly do in a state institution for the alumni to be the leading factors in the control of the institution. It is a wise policy, it seems to me, to have the trustees appointed by the governor or elected by the people. If it would seem best to have the people elect them, this election should be removed as far as possible from general elections. Politics should be completely divorced from educational matters. I like the plan for the appointment by the governor and then this appointment should be confirmed by the senate. Your suggestion as to the chancellor and treasurer is a good one. (2) I agree fully as to the election of a president by the faculty, but there might be serious difficulty under present conditions. A man of strong personality would be elected whether he was a desirable man or not. (3) I think this would be an admirable plan and give unity of thought and action and tend to promote the effectiveness of university or college organization. (4) I am in hearty <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page308" title="308"></span>sympathy with this. In recent years questions of policy have been delegated to the deans. I hardly think this a very effective way of improving a university or college. (5) I like the university senate idea. The senate to be elected by representatives of the department. I am fully convinced we are becoming autocratic instead of democratic. The action of the senate should not be final, but a report be made to the members of the faculty, who should in turn make a report to the board. This will give the largest amount of freedom and insure a wise action. I have many times observed that good ideas come from the younger men of the faculty.</p>

    <p>I approve most heartily the general tenor of the plan of university control proposed for discussion in your letter of December first, and I endorse unreservedly the closing sentences of the first paragraph, "Under these conditions . . . whom they serve," which I regard as formulating the essential characteristics of the proposed line of action. I have myself thought quite a little on this question (who that has long witnessed the friction, humiliations and injustices of the present system has not?), and I mention a few changes that have been in my mind as improvements on existent conditions. I need not say that these do not constitute a well thought out plan like yours, but they may serve as discussions of the corresponding portions of the latter. (1) The internal affairs of each school or college to be entirely governed by its own faculty. (2) The faculty to consist of all permanently appointed instructors. (3) Instructors to be permanently appointed by the faculty upon nomination by the department in which they are to serve; only men may be nominated who have taught five years in one or more institutions of collegiate rank, and of these years at least the last three must have been in the recommending department. Appointments prior to permanent appointment to be annual, and to be made in the same way as the latter. When the conditions for permanent appointment have been met, the candidate shall either be so appointed or not reappointed at all. (4) The "Department of -----," to consist of all members of the faculty whose chief work lies in the field named. A department shall not be established or continued with fewer than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page309" title="309"></span>five members; fields of work that would have a departmental faculty of fewer than five members shall be amalgamated with cognate fields. (5) Salary advances to be automatic. (6) Promotion in rank (assistant professor, professor) to be made (after at least five years of service in the present rank) by the faculty upon nomination of the department. Promotion to confer no increase of salary, but to give increased voting power in the faculties, general and departmental (assistant professor two votes, professor three votes). (7) Men who have served in other first-class institutions shall upon permanent appointment be given the place in the salary scale which they would have attained if the time had been spent in this institution; they may be given any rank not higher than that which they could have attained in this institution in the same time. (Note.â€”The condition of No. 3 above, requiring three successive annual appointments prior to permanent appointment, shall in no case be waived.) (8) Appointments and promotions to be made on the basis of scholastic attainments and promise only, particularly in the lines of research, teaching or both; administrative services shall not be taken into account. The specific qualifications upon which any permanent appointment or promotion is to be based shall be stated by the department in writing and at the time of making its nomination. This formulation shall be published with the official announcement of the appointment or promotion. (9) The president shall be elected by the faculty or faculties of the institution from among their own membership. Voting by mail shall be allowed, and a majority of the total number of votes in all the faculties shall be requisite for election. The term of office of the president shall be fixed by the faculty prior to the election. The duties and powers of the president shall provisionally remain as heretofore except as otherwise provided. (10) The head or chairman of a department to be chosen annually by the department, reelection permitted and desirable. His duties to be those of a chairman together with such others as may be assigned to him by the department. He shall receive additional remuneration proportionate to the additional work done by him as head or chairman. (11) The faculties shall have the right, jointly and severally, to constitute other bodies, temporary or permanent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page310" title="310"></span>(senate, committees, etc.), and to delegate to these any or all of their own powers, for a definite time, or indefinitely subject to revocation. I could continue and make provision for other essential phases of university control (many of which you have admirably covered in your own draft), but I have said enough to block out my line of thought. Of all that I have said, I regard the following as by far the most important: (I.) Salary increases to be automatic; (II.) Appointments and promotions to be made by the faculty upon nomination of the department. When these two regulations are once established, the others will gradually work themselves out. And it seems to me that it would not be too brusque a change to put these two regulations into operation at once. The question is how to persuade those in power in any given institution to do so. I do not doubt that the present plan of benevolent despotism is thoroughly unsatisfactory to the rank and file of the faculties of our universities. But how can it be altered? The individual is powerless; papers appear from time to time in journals discussing various phases of the situationâ€” for example, your own article in Science in 1906, and that heartrending picture of the "Pressure upon the Professor," in the Saturday Evening Post of June 11, 1910, but they seem to produce no tangible effects; no organization exists that can and will champion the cause. Accordingly I give your labors a most heartfelt welcome, and trust that you will be able so to focus the thought of the country as to make it effectively felt. Three possibilities (alas! all remote, I fear) come to mind; one is that philanthropists may be moved to condition sufficiently large and attractive gifts to universities upon the establishment of the two regulations mentioned; another is that the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching may be induced to use its powers in the interests of bringing about such regulations; and third, that separate boards of trustees may be led to establish these regulations for their own institutions. In the last case, the great obstacle will be found in the fact that the existent ideal is largely what you so aptly call that of the "department-store system." Commercial men dominate many boards of trustees, and they do not seem to realize that because success is attained by placing a department of a railroad, a factory or a store under <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page311" title="311"></span>the absolute control of one man and holding him responsible for results (results that can readily be measured and that must in the nature of things be brought about by a distinctly inferior personnel acting in a strictly subordinate manner), it does not follow that the same policy will be equally successful in a department of a university, where the head is at most <i>primus inter pares</i>. I trust that you will give the results of your investigation wide publicity and that you will bring them effectively to the attention of every individual or organization that may be able in any way to contribute to the amelioration of the situation. You are at liberty to quote anonymously any portion of what I have said, and it is not the least significant part of my reply that I make it actually anonymous. I do not in the slightest degree question your own personal secrecy, but in view of the extreme delicacy of the subject and in view of the possible vicissitudes of anything that is once committed to writing, I prefer that these sheets should not bear my name.</p>
