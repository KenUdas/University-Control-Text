    <h2 class="UC_heading2">II. A Referendum On Administration</h2>

    <p><span class="first_word">The</span> problems of university control were reviewed in a short article printed in <i class="calibre25">Science</i> some six years ago. This was reprinted with certain added footnotes, and at the beginning of December, 1911, sent to our leading men of science, who hold or have held academic positions, with the following note:</p>

    <blockquote class="quotation">Would you be willing to give your opinion of the plan of university control here proposed? If you are so kind as to do so, I shall understand that I may quote anonymously your reply.</blockquote>

    <p>About 300 replies were received, and are printed practically in full in this book. The article on which the replies were based is as follows:</p>

    <section id="part01chapter02sub01" epub:type="subchapter">

      <h3 id="uHWYCs2WMlfcVv8jNImDx5D" class="UC_heading3">University Control<a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note01" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note01">1</a></h3>

      <p>In the colleges from which our universities have developed the problem of administration was comparatively simple. The faculty and the president met weekly and consulted daily; each was familiar with the work of the entire institution; a spirit of cooperation and loyalty naturally prevailed. The trustees also understood the economy of the college and were able to work intelligently for the general good. But when a university covers the whole field of human knowledge, when it is concerned with professional work in divergent directions, when it adds research and creative scholarship to instruction, when both men and women are admitted, when there are 500 instructors and 5,000 students, it is no longer possible for each trustee and for each professor to share intelligently in the conduct of the whole institution. We appear at present to be between the Scylla of presidential autocracy and the Charybdis of faculty and trustee incompetence. The more incompetent the faculties become, the greater is the need for executive autocracy, and the greater the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page18" title="18"></span>autocracy of the president, the more incompetent do the faculties become. Under these conditions it appears that the university must be completely reorganized on a representative basis. It should not be a despotism and it can not be a simple democracy. Autonomy should be given to the schools, departments or divisions. The administrative, legislative and judicial work must be done by experts, but they should represent those whom they serve. . . .</p>

      <p>The present writer ventures to propose tentatively the following form of organization for our larger universities, to be reached as the result of a gradual evolution: <a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note02" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note02">2</a></p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p class="no_indent_margins">There should be a corporation consisting of the professors and other officers of the university, the alumni who maintain their interest in the institution and members of the community who ally themselves with it.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note03" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note03">3</a>  In the case of the state universities part of the corporation would be elected by the people. This corporation should elect trustees having the ordinary functions of trusteesâ€”the care of the property and the representation of the common sense of the corporation and of the community in university policy.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note04" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note04">4</a>  The trustees should elect a chancellor<a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note05" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note05">5</a>  and a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page19" title="19"></span>treasurer who would represent the university in its relations with the community.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="no_indent_margins">The professors or officers, or their representatives, should elect a president who has expert knowledge of education and of university administration. His salary should not be larger, his position more dignified or his powers greater than those of the professor. <a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note06" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note06">6</a> </p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="no_indent_margins">The unit of organization within the university should be the school, division or department, a group of men having common objects and interests, who can meet frequently and see each other daily. It should be large enough to meet for deliberation and to represent diverse points of view, but small enough for each to understand the whole and to feel responsible for it. The size of this group is prescribed by a psychological constant, its efficient maximum being about twenty men and its minimum about ten.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note07" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note07">7</a></p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="no_indent_margins"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page20" title="20"></span>Each school, division or department should elect its dean or chairman and its executive committee, and have as complete autonomy as is consistent with the welfare of the university as a whole.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note08" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note08">8</a> It should elect its minor officers and nominate its professors. The nominations for professorships should be subject to the approval of a board of advisers constituted for each department, consisting, say, of two members of the department, two experts in the subject outside the university and two professors from related departments. The final election should be by a university senate, subject to the veto of the trustees. The same salaries should be paid for the same office and the same amount of work. The election should be for life, except in the case of impeachment after trial.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note09" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note09">9</a> The division should have financial as well as educational autonomy. Its income should be held as a trust fund and it should be encouraged to increase this fund.</p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p class="no_indent_margins">The departments or divisions should elect representatives <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page21" title="21"></span>for such committees as are needed when they have common interests, and to a senate which should legislate for the university as a whole and be a body coordinate with the trustees. It should have an executive committee which would meet with a similar committee of the trustees. There should also on special occasions be plenums of divisions having interests in common and plenums of all the professors or officers of the university.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note10" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note10">10</a> There should be as much flexibility and as complete anarchy throughout the university as is consistent with unity and order.</p>

        </li>

      </ol>

      <p>It seems that the 299 replies expressing the opinions of the writers on these proposals represent with considerable accuracy the existing academic sentiment in this country among those who have been most successful in their work. They are all from men in the natural and exact sciences, who form somewhat less than half our university professors, but there is no reason to suppose that their colleagues in other departments would differ as a class in their attitude on academic questions. I wrote to scientific men because I had a list of those of highest standing and am personally acquainted with most of them. It may be that in some cases men were more likely to reply because they agreed with my views and were more likely to emphasize their agreement than their dissent. As a psychologist by trade, I judge, however, that this is more than balanced by the opposite tendency to react by objecting and to argue against a proposition proposed. Probably the replies of younger men and of less successful men would be more radical and more opposed to the existing system of university control.</p>

      <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page22" title="22"></span>The letters are well worth a careful reading. We are told that every question has two sides; as a matter of fact many questions are polygons. The problems of the administration of an educational institution have many sides and many angles. They differ completely in the small college and in the large university, in the newer and in the older institutions, in the state university and in the private corporation. My paper was written with reference to the large endowed universities, especially those which have enjoyed or suffered a rapid growth in size and scope. The replies are from institutions of all kinds. Those who hold chairs in the smaller colleges may find a system fairly adequate to their needs which would be undesirable in our large universities. Those in state universities may regard as necessary a strong executive responsible to the people and professors subordinated to the public service, when they would not approve of the irresponsible autocracy of the private corporations. Professors at Harvard and Yale may take satisfaction in the long traditions and wise precedents which obtain at these universities, when they would not care to live under the system in use at Columbia and Chicago.</p>

      <p>It was originally my intention to base this essay on an analysis of the letters received, but the exigencies of an engagement made it necessary to prepare its first version before the proofs could be obtained, the letters written and the replies received. It is indeed somewhat difficult to summarize such a large number of points of view which represent both real differences of opinion and differences due to the fact that various situations were under consideration. It seems best to print the letters, and to permit those interested to draw their own conclusions.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note11" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note11">11</a> The letters will be given under the institu<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page23" title="23"></span>tion from which they come when there are as many as ten replies, the institutions otherwise being grouped. In general, the letters are placed in the order of their preference for the existing system of university control which I designate as a limited autocracy. Omissions have been made from some of the longer letters, and formal compliments, apologies and the like have been erased. Thus a large percentage of all letters begin with the phrase, "I have read with interest," etc. Other slight editorial revision, such as eliminating the paragraphs, has been undertaken, but every effort has been made not to alter in the slightest degree the opinions expressed. There is given here a table showing the source of the replies and the only classification that I</p>

<p class="no_indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page24" title="24"></span>shall attempt to make. Its validity can be judged by those who care to read the letters.</p>

      <p>Of the 299 replies 46 are taken as favoring the system usual in this country, which is designated as a limited autocracy, 68 as favoring a system in which the faculties have greater share in control, as at Yale or the Johns Hopkins Medical School, 185 as favoring a plan of representative democracy more or less similar to the one proposed. Five sixths of those holding the most important scientific chairs at our universities believe that there should be a change in administrative methods in the direction of limiting the powers of the president and other executive officers and making them responsible to those engaged in the work of teaching and research. This is an agreement greater than I had anticipated. When eighty-five per cent. of those responsible for the conduct of a given system unite in holding that it should be altered, the case may be regarded as strong. Political and social changes are usually made on a much narrower majority. It is true that five of the six presidents who repliedâ€”they are of course at the same time men who formerly did distinguished scientific workâ€”form part of the minority. Indeed, a large percentage of this minority consists of presidents, directors, deans and other university officials.<a class="super_original" id="p01_c02_note12" href="backmatter_endnotes.html#p01_c02_note12">12</a> Whether this should be interpreted as that much in favor of the present system, or that much more against it, may be left an open question.</p>

      <p>A considerable number of professors at Harvard favor <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page25" title="25"></span>the existing system, but their preference applies to their own situation, where the administrative autocracy is tempered. Of 19 replies from Wisconsin and Illinois, eight favor a limited autocracy, but they have in mind their system, which is not the same as that of the private universities. Probably they would in any case prefer the methods of President Van Hise and President James to those of President Draper. Those who want a strong executive responsible to the people of the state have been classed in the group favoring a limited autocracy. Thus the two replies from Columbia which are placed in this group are from men who do not trust faculty control, though, as I happen to know, they are by no means satisfied with the existing situation. If these two cases are omitted, we find that of 70 replies from Columbia, Pennsylvania, Cornell, Johns Hopkins and Chicagoâ€” these are the institutions which I had especially in mind in my proposalsâ€”only one (an executive officer) favors the existing system, eleven favor greater faculty control, and 58 a complete change which would make the administration responsible to the faculties. This is surely a condition which foretells reform or bankruptcy.</p>
