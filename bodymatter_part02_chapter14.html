    <h2 class="calibre9">XIV. Letters from the University of Michigan</h2>

    <p>In your paper on "University Control" you have very clearly stated the three main objections which may be raised against our present system of university administration. The plan by which you propose to remedy these evils will in general commend itself to the majority of professors, especially in the larger institutions in which, on account of the unwieldy size of the faculty, practically all matters of importance are regularly referred to committees. Such committees are appointed by the president, or, if the matter under consideration concerns a particular college, the committee, while appointed by the president, is practically the choice of the dean. Under an autocratic president or dean the same men are again and again appointed and become soon known as "administration men." Of course, to save appearances, the names of one or two "dissenters," always in a safe minority, may also appear on the list. Election of important committees by the faculty, instead of appointment, seems to me to be the first step needed in a reform. The autonomy of larger groups inside the college would be the next step. This is especially needed in the large colleges of liberal arts, where even fair-sized subdivisions of closely related departments could be established. Each group should elect its own dean for a limited term of years, subject to reelection. It seems to me that such a plan should find favor with the deans themselves. It is a thankless task to be a dean and well-nigh impossible to please all faculty members. Even exemplary deans are often severely criticized. The trouble is that the chronic fault-finders do the most talking, while the majority is satisfied and seldom heard from. The reelection of a good dean might stop all idle criticism. A board of deans, as proposed above, will be large enough to eliminate any danger of autocratic power on the part of any single individual, a danger which, in the case of a large college, may be as real as that of an autocratic president. I heartily <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page214" title="214"></span>agree with you that nominations for professorships and promotions to such positions should be made by a committee of the faculty, the final decision resting with the senate. The latter should consist of the deans and an additional member elected from each group. I feel very uncertain that the election of the president by the faculty would be practicable. This should be left to a smaller body, for example, the board of deans. I should be strongly opposed to a short term of office for the president as well as for the deans. If they are elected in the manner proposed, they will be our leaders. They will have definite policies which they wish to carry through. A university is a conservative institution and any reform will require some time to be carried through and a change of leadership may prove disastrous. In Germany, so frequently quoted, the highest educational authority is a "Ministerium" in which no annual changes take place, as in the rectorat of the university. It has always seemed to me that the positions of president or dean in an American university are by no means ones to be coveted. They will become still less so if their present power be taken from them. What would remain? Principally such disagreeable duties as to listen to complaints of various factions of the faculty or to smooth over personal controversies, etc. I do not see that you have left to these positions much more than to serve as buffers for clashing opinions. Even the pleasure of serving as the representative of the university at public ceremonies may not outweigh the objectionable features of the positions. You must show that there is enough left to make them attractive to our best men. It seems to me unjust that a president should receive a salary not larger than that of a professor. His expenses must necessarily be greater, especially if he is expected to represent the university on public occasions. There are one or two more points which should be considered very carefully. In your scheme the student has not once been mentioned. A great deal of the time of a president and dean is taken up with matters of a disciplinary nature. Who is going to take up this disagreeable task? If the college of liberal arts should be divided into separate groups, which dean should be entrusted with such an office? Do you wish a special "dean" to be elected, with similar functions as the dean of women, now so <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page215" title="215"></span>familiar to all co-educational institutions? Should these deans have the same authority as the "academic" deans? If the faculty is progressive it will elect its most eminent scholars to the most honored positions—and these should be those of president and dean. They are our natural leaders. But from my experience with our best men I know that they are in general not interested in matters of discipline or the management of the student body. I see a great danger in your plan, namely, that of creating a university for the professors—not for the students. A university founded on your scheme will be a very attractive place for a professor. He seems to have all the rights he wishes and apparently no duties. We are all human and I wonder if some of us who love research work and are sure of a life-long appointment might not be tempted to forget that we should also use our best endeavors to transmit the little we know to our students. Certainly a university, especially a state university, which would neglect its students would in a very short time be called to account by the people of the state. Any plan of university control should indeed look towards an alleviation of the real causes for complaint by the professors, but as much towards the solution of the problem, how to get the best results from our students for whose sake the universities have been founded. This latter question seems to have received too little attention. I know that the professors have real grievances. But I do not believe that we shall accomplish much at the present time by a utopian plan. We must propose something that can be put into practise in the near future. The whole question is one of evolution, not revolution. By not asking too much at present we may accomplish a great deal in the future.</p>

    <p>My judgment causes me to approve in general of the preliminary paragraph; the paragraph number (1) seems to me not suited to state universities; paragraph number (2) is not approved; (3) and (4) are approved; (5) is approved in general, but that relative powers would need careful elaboration. As to the plan in paragraph (2), it would seem to me that in the ever-intense interchange between university and public in America a presiding officer is necessary with greater powers, greater con-<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page216" title="216"></span>tinuity of policy, and different qualities from those of the average professor.</p>

    <p>I think I should hardly favor such a plan in all its details.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that one of the most important things in university control is the selection and appointment of the presidents and the professors. In my opinion, the president of a university should be selected and nominated by the university senate, consisting of the full professors from the different departments. Upon his nomination by this body, the board of control, or regents, as we call them, should make the appointment. I think that it is bad policy to have the president of a university selected wholly by the board of control. He should be selected and nominated by representatives from the different departments or schools. In the second place, all new professors should be selected and nominated by the faculty of the school to which they are called, the appointment of course to be made by the board of control, or regents. In the third place, the dean of each department should be selected and nominated by the full professors of his department, and his appointment will have to be made by the board of control. In the fourth place, all promotions should be made on the recommendation of the faculty, to which the one recommended for promotion belongs. I am not so sure about the salary of the president. I think it might be somewhat larger than that of a professor, but I do not believe that it should be in great excess of the professorial salary. I am quite sure that it is a serious mistake to pay excessive salaries to presidents and deans. The dean of a department should have no bigger salary than that of the best professors in his department. In my opinion, more good men have left this university, not on account of the inadequacy of their salary, but because they have seen men, acknowledged to be wholly inferior to themselves, greatly increased in salary, through the influence of the dean or by direct influence upon the board of regents.</p>

    <p>I find myself in entire sympathy with your plan broadly considered; for I feel that at present we are generally drifting without a chart and as chance propels us. I should like further <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page217" title="217"></span>to see a sharp line of cleavage between the junior and the senior college, which separation would be reflected in the rank and pay of professors as well as in the organization of the university. The work of the last two years in the undergraduate courses is less differentiated from the graduate school than it is from the freshman and sophomore years. Elementary mathematics, English, modern languages in the earlier stages, logic and philosophy and like subjects will always make a demand for a large number of teachers who should be good drill masters, but whose horizon need not be that of the professor who regularly instructs upper classmen and graduates. I am a little in doubt concerning the quality of president that will be evolved under your system, but since he must be elected by the professors, it may be that that point is sufficiently guarded.</p>

    <p>There can be no doubt that at the present the administrative phases of the universities are altogether over-developed, and too much importance is placed upon them. For the most part the control of all universities is in the hands of trustees who have first-hand knowledge only of finances and the physical side of the university equipment, buildings, grounds, etc., and tend to be interested in athletics alone of all the university activities. Usually they are wise enough to leave the details of administration to others, but nothing prevents them from interfering at any point, and cases are constantly coming up where they are helping a friend on the faculty or blocking promotions of people whom for any reason they may dislike, and interfering with educational policies. The faculty, as you point out, is altogether at the mercy of all the powers above. While faculty sentiment in the long run plays an enormous part in the determination of all university affairs, it is altogether indirect in its expression, there is no recognized medium of communication with governing bodies, to say nothing of any direct control. Under the present condition all depends upon the president. The trustees turn most matters over to him for administration, he it is that represents faculty sentiment before the board. Where the president is at once politic and strong and wise in all matters of university policy, all goes well. Where he is weak, the trustees run matters <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page218" title="218"></span>on a political basis; when strong and unwise, he dominates board and faculty to the injury of all. Under your plan, as I understand it, the faculty would have power and direct representation as well as the privilege of making the university and governing it by opinion. It might be objected that the faculties are on the whole not suited to take part in government. It is true that much acquaintance with faculty administration makes for pessimism. Legislation often results from log-rolling for students rather than from any far-sighted policy. Those who carry most weight are frequently not the men of recognized ability as scholars, but administrators or pseudo-administrators whose chief claim to prominence is political skill. But this again is probably largely an outgrowth of the methods of choosing professors and the forces that make for advancement. At present in many universities advancement depends upon four factors which are, in order of importance, activity in administration (often doing the work of a ten-dollar-a-week clerk), number of students, real teaching ability, and scholarship and productivity. The president and deans can know personally only the men who serve on routine committees, and are in a position to judge them only on their efficiency in that work, which usually demands rather a low order of intelligence. The teaching ability they must judge from the size of the classes and chance remarks of students. They have time for no more than an occasional visit to class rooms, which, if made, would be often misleading. Of scholarly work and character they have no opportunity to know, and necessarily would, for the most part, be incapable of judging if they did take pains to examine it. In consequence, members of the faculties busy themselves with the externals and unessentials. They look for opportunities to sit upon committees, they work for legislation that will give them more students, or under the elective system they make their courses attractive to students, even if they must sacrifice something of real value or make the courses easy in the attempt. Scholarship and the essentials take a second place in the mind of the professor as in the mind of governing bodies. Men are held to their real work by the approbation of workers in the same field without the university, not by any recognition or reward at home. Were the selection of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page219" title="219"></span>professors made to depend upon scholarship, teaching and administrative ability in due proportion, and only the best be selected, many of the unworthy features of faculty politics would disappear of themselves. This can only be brought about by having the selections by a committee with knowledge on all points, as you suggest. One feature that you overlook in the high salaries paid to administrative officers is their value in offering a few prizes in the academic work. This in itself is desirable. The objection is that it again puts the emphasis upon administrative ability rather than upon scholarship. Advancement to these positions is through subordinate offices, committee chairmanships and the like, that require no particular scholarly ability and are likely to detract from real scholarly work. In every university men who might accomplish something are wasting all their spare time from the class room doing purely clerical work. Through it some few advance to deanships, but a large number merely wreck their scholarly careers. If the prizes could be made rewards for scholarly accomplishments, and the clerical work be done by clerks, there would be a double saving. On the whole, I think your suggestions would be practical, provided they could be adopted in their entirety. I see no way at present for their introduction except by the voluntary action of trustees and regents. Legal traditions seem to require some such body as the responsible financial authorities, and simplicity is furthered by giving them final authority in all matters. But boards seem to be more and more impressed by their inability to manage details and by their general ignorance of educational policy. It seems reasonable to hope that they will soon look for a fundamental solution of the problems rather than a temporary relief from shifting them to the most convenient shoulders.</p>

    <p>(1) Either the state (eliminated in the case of privately endowed institutions) or the corporation (constituted as suggested, and desirable even in case of state universities to promote more intimate relations between the university and the people) should elect trustees, regents and treasurer—chancellor no function. (2) Professors elect president. Should be a great honor and the salary enough to tempt scholars for limited term. President's <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page220" title="220"></span>work should be so lightened by clerks that he can devote as much time to productive scholarship after election to office as before. Does not need to make so many speeches. (3) Unit of organization—group. (4) Agree completely, except in matter of salaries. These should be as flexible as possible, and, within the economic limits set for universities, as nearly as possible the numerical expressions of (a) success in productive scholarship, (6) success in teaching, and (c) skill in administration. The idea of trust funds is very important. At present money is wasted in great quantities at the end of each year in order to insure an equally large appropriation for the next, and to prove that "the department is growing"! (5) Agree theoretically. Practically am very doubtful, for at present owing to inter-departmental rivalry for students, not in scholarship, and innumerable petty jealousies due to the immorality of the academic type, it would be difficult to find representatives who would do more than represent themselves. In this respect we are face to face with the same problems presented by state legislatures and congress.</p>

    <p>Your plan of university control meets my approval in its essential features. Since you have asked it, I will list the special things that appeal to me, or alterations, as follows, using the same heads employed by you: (1) Corporation. Endowment university. Faculty; members of alumni association; friends. State university; all voters of state. Trustees, twelve in number, elected by members of the corporation. (2) President or chancellor. To act as chairman of board of trustees. A man of prominence—giving his whole time to university and paid somewhat more than the professor. His duty would be to supervise both the administrative and educational policies of the university. He would be elected by the faculty through its senate, subject to veto of trustees. Treasurer, secretary and other administrative officers to be appointed by trustees to work in cooperation with the president. (3) Same as stated by you. (4) Would omit the sentence regarding the "board of advisers" for the nomination of professors. I believe it would be unwieldy under some circumstances. Otherwise I concur in this whole paragraph. (5) There should be a university senate consisting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page221" title="221"></span>of the deans, executive committees of the several faculties, with the president of the university as chairman, for consideration of questions affecting the university as a whole. Communications could be made to the trustees either from the faculty as a whole, through its senate, or from the individual units of the faculty through their dean.</p>

    <p>I am in hearty sympathy with the spirit of your proposals, but I should hardly feel competent to judge of the advisability of the details. I am sure most of us who have taught many years will agree with you that it is high time to give the faculty a larger share in the real management of the university.</p>

    <p>I approve heartily of the whole of your plan, but I should proceed very slowly in carrying into effect the first provision. Such a corporation as is proposed should include a majority of persons of university ideals (as distinguished from college ideals). In my experience such men are rare in university governing boards; they are not in the majority among executive officers; the faculties themselves contain many who hold that our so-called universities are teaching institutions only. I know of one head of a large department who "instructs" or advises his "subordinates" to restrict their activities to teaching. Among those interested in the university in the general population are exceedingly few who have any notion of real university aims. Under these conditions corporation control seems to me very hazardous. I fear that a corporation with merely advisory powers would be troublesome. This of course refers to our western universities. I hope to see the time when some such plan as yours is put into operation. When that should happen in any institution ought to depend on the extent to which university ideals have become current. Where a majority of the faculties lacks them, an autocratic president and deans may accomplish more than a democratic organization. In the organization of a graduate school, I do not see how the wisdom of your plan can be questioned, except as to the first provision.</p>
