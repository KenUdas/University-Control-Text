    <h2 class="calibre9">V. Letters from the Johns Hopkins University</h2>

    <p>With regard to the first proposition, the suggestion of forming a corporation consisting of the professors, officers and alumni, does not meet my approval. The only feature that makes membership in such a corporation desirable is the privilege of voting for trustees. In the first place I do not feel that this privilege alone would suffice to secure a paying membership, such as is contemplated in the proposition. In the second place, I should not like to see trustees chosen by this method. It would seem to me to carry with it all the difficulties inherent in political elections—namely, parties, electioneering machinery—a continual agitation to arouse the interest of the better element to meet the designs of those who were acting from self-interest or ignorance. The most important work of trustees, in my opinion, is to safeguard the financial interests of the university, and for this purpose they should form a small body, the individuals of which should be selected by the board itself, or in the case of state universities by some responsible authority, e. g., the governor of the state. It should be a permanent board made up of citizens of standing, men of integrity and ability, whose interest in public affairs will induce them to accept such a trust in spite of the fact that it brings work and responsibility without any personal profit. I do not feel that a board of this character can be obtained by a general election among alumni. It would be difficult or impossible for the alumni to acquire the information requisite for intelligent voting. In regard to the second proposition, I am heartily in favor of the suggestion that the president shall be appointed by the trustees upon nomination by the faculty—he should be the choice of the faculty—I believe that such a method of selection would strengthen greatly the bonds between president and faculty, especially if there was added the further provision that all appointments and appropriations be made upon recommendation of the faculty or of some board representing the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page108" title="108"></span>faculty and chosen from its membership by election. I do not however, agree to the latter part of proposition (2). I believe that the presidency should be a dignified and desirable office in order to attract the best men. It should be permanent, it ought to carry a salary larger than that of the professor, and the incumbent should be charged especially with the important duty of developing the policy of the university. Some one is needed in this position who is broad-minded enough to sympathize with good movements and to see that they are pushed—to recognize when there is weakness to be overcome or strength to be encouraged. No temporary officer can be expected to keep his mind constantly upon such work. If the office is temporary and carries no special dignity or importance, men will avoid it and, if forced to take it in rotation, will regard it as a necessary evil that they are thankful to escape from. Propositions (3) and (4) meet my general approval. When the size of any department is considerable, it would seem desirable to have its own faculty and dean, to make its own nominations to the staff and its own recommendations for appropriations and other departmental expenditures. As you say, such an organization practically exists for the professional schools, although in many cases the autonomy is not carried far enough; that is to say, it does not extend to appropriations and appointments. I count it unfortunate that there is a tendency to make the deanship in such departmental faculties a practically permanent office. In the case of professional schools that are not really incorporated into the university, such a provision may be necessary, but when the department is organically united to the university the deanship, in my opinion, should be an office filled in rotation, yearly, by the professors of the department. A department is small enough for the professors themselves, as a body, to develop their policy and supervise their own needs, present and future, and the dean should be simply an administrative officer for carrying their actions into effect. The office might properly be regarded as a burdensome duty and not an honor, and the labor might be shared equally so as not to spoil the efficiency of any professor in the proper work of his own subject. In this general respect I should like to see a marked difference made between the position of the president and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page109" title="109"></span> the deans. The latter now generally fulfill the duties of minor presidents and there is no need, in my opinion, in one and the same university in having a group of men taken away from their proper work. It may very well lead to sharp antagonisms between individuals. In regard to proposition (5) I assume that some such representative body is necessary in large institutions where many departments exist. I would suggest that its most important function should be the recommendation of a proper division of the annual income among the several departments, in addition to acting as a final court in matters affecting the interests of all departments. It should be a representative body subject to change.</p>

    <p>I thoroughly agree with (1) and the first part of (2); I think the president should be elected by the faculty and feel responsible to it for appointments, so far as they are in his hands, and general politics, but to the trustees for the financial part. I am inclined to favor a "rector" elected from the full professors for a period of, say, four years; his administrative work should not take him away from his department entirely. I believe that he should have a larger salary and be able to travel and entertain in the name of the university. A four years' tenure would put a man on his mettle, for I think he should be subject to reelection. I see evident weaknesses in this which I shall not discuss. (3) -and (4) appeal to me and also (5) except for the last sentence. I do not believe that there is any group of men who abuse their freedom as much as do some university professors and I believe that this abuse tends to lower the average and dignity of all. You see, I am a complete Philistine on this subject. I believe that each head of a department should send the president a written report of his work at least every three months, these reports to be kept on file. I even favor the establishment of rules relating to hours. Of course I believe in absolute freedom in research, but I think it only fair that we give evidence of being worthy of our position and salary and see no reason for assuming that students and teachers are so different from the rest of mankind as not to need some control.</p>

    <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page110" title="110"></span>Along general lines I agree with you, as, for instance, that the several faculties (law, medicine, etc.) should possess autonomy, should nominate their own professors; that there should be as much flexibility and as little of the department-store system in a university organization as is consistent with the progress of research and with the advancement of learning. On these and many other points I should be at one with you, but when it comes to the details of a scheme such as you have analyzed I should wish time for study of the question—time to study the methods of university control in Germany, England and other countries— before expressing an opinion.</p>

    <p>I think we are beginning to see indications for "university control" by the members of the faculty. Our medical faculty here is largely in control, not by right, but by assent. Such responsibility makes us more interested in educational problems, in economy of funds, and breeds loyalty, which, after all, is of the greatest importance.</p>

    <p>I can say that the plan of university organization that you outline strikes me as in its main lines highly desirable, and in its aims altogether excellent. With its leading purpose, that of securing and developing the independence and the individuality of the professor, I am in the heartiest possible sympathy.</p>

    <p>On the whole your plan seems to me excellent. It is in accord with the historical development of university organization, and while very different from the plan now followed in America, it seems to me that a gradual adoption of it would be beneficial.</p>

    <p>I approve of your scheme of university control.</p>

    <p>I read your proposal with much interest and approval. I have no suggestions to offer at the present time.</p>

    <p>Such an organization would go a long way towards solving our present difficulties of administration, meaning by "our" those of many institutions throughout the country. My limited experience with university presidents has led me to believe that some of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page111" title="111"></span>them at least are incompetent. When it comes to new appointments, their lack of knowledge of suitable men to fill vacant positions is often surprising. I am fully convinced that the appointive or nominative power is best in the hands of such a committee as you suggest.</p>

    <p>The democratic features of your plan must certainly appeal to all who are intimate with the present unsatisfactory state. I think any attempt at a modification of existing methods of university government should include some means of setting a standard for and effecting a scrutiny of the work of a department head. Existing abuse of the responsibilities of this position should not be lost sight of in your scheme.</p>

    <p>I am very much in sympathy with your proposed plan of control of universities. In my estimation the president should have a somewhat higher salary than professors, but the differences that now exist in colleges as well as universities are unreasonable. The excessive (relatively excessive) salary commanded by certain presidents is owing to their reputation as financial agents. If a man is able to raise money for an institution he can command almost any salary. Just what bearing your plan would have on the financial management of institutions of learning could hardly be predicted. However, it would tend to bring to the head of such institutions men of scholarship rather than men of marked business abilities and such men would undoubtedly, with the cooperation of the professors, as outlined in your plan, be able to direct the real functions of educational institutions infinitely better than an autocratic business executive.</p>

    <p>Paragraphs (2) and (4) seem to me to be very well stated; certainly I subscribe to them most heartily. I confess that paragraph (1) is not so clear to me. I see possibilities there of great confusion. The corporation might easily become so large that certain tendencies and attitudes might be forced upon the professors which are not representative of the best interests of the university. If the voting power of the corporation could be so arranged that the professorial vote would represent half of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page112" title="112"></span>total and the outside members the other half, I think the plan might work very well. In regard to paragraph (3) it seems worth saying that the plan you call for is rather artificial unless you would hold to a more strict departmental grouping than I think your wording called for. Such large groupings would be hard to make and would eventually lead to friction. I think I am more in favor of autonomy for the professors than for the group, yet such a condition of affairs might lead to anarchy. The grouping psychology, philosophy, chemistry, physics, etc., are natural growths. In certain departments there are only one or two professors; such departments should be grouped by themselves and not forced to become a part of a larger whole.</p>

    <p>I am heartily in favor of such a plan. I have been connected with German universities and have talked with a number of professors in Germany, France and England, as well as here in America. I feel very keenly that our present system will have to be modified somewhat according to your proposed plan, and it should be done as soon as possible. We are very fortunate here in Johns Hopkins University, of course, for we have, as you know, a university council which advises the president. Even here, however, there is a tendency toward an autocratic "one-man power" in the departments, in that the so-called "director" of the department has considerably more authority than is sometimes wise. Although there is sometimes talk against our "one-man system," you see that, as a whole, the wisdom of our leading men here in the university has kept things going on a sane basis. Considering the matter entirely independently of our own immediate surroundings, however, I should like to see a more democratic control established in our American universities.</p>

    <p>I agree with you that for the successful development of the American university in the future, a change in the form of administration which at present dominates our higher institutions of learning is imperative. Certain recent developments have shown the danger of concentrating too much power in the hands of any one man. If a professor in one of our leading universities is to be dismissed not only without a trial before a jury of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page113" title="113"></span>professors, but even without a hearing by the president of the university in question, the dignity and honor appertaining to an American professorship would be so slight that much of the very best intellect of this country would be turned away from the universities into safer channels. The results from this cause alone would be greatly to weaken our higher institutions of learning, and to foster the already overwhelming commercialism of this country. I think the policy outlined in (1) is good, except that I would not have a chancellor. The organization should be kept as simple as possible, to avoid any unnecessary sources of autocracy finding a foothold. All financial matters should be left to the trustees, and they should be expected to secure the necessary endowment. The financial affairs of the institution should be the chief, if not the sole, function of the trustees. I agree with (2), except I would not preserve the name president, since this has now come to have a well-defined significance. I would call the officer in question, perhaps, "rector," as in the German universities. He should be elected for one year, with the possibility of reelection—but in no case should be eligible for more than three years. His salary should be exactly that of a professor and his powers the same as those of any professor. His office, however, should, I think, be looked upon as even more dignified than that of a professorship. The point made in section (4), that the same salary should be paid for the same office, the same amount of work and the same tenure of office, is, I think, fundamentally important. That is, I believe, the case at Harvard, and largely the case at Yale. The opposite policy of obtaining, and especially of retaining, a professor for the smallest sum to which he, by any method, can be induced to submit, is shortsighted, and not conducive to the highest results. This method fosters discontent, and often indifference and inefficiency. It deals with the professor by the same method that a corporation deals with its hirelings, and thus detracts from the dignity and desirableness of the position. I would add that publicity in all such matters is absolutely essential to the good-will and harmonious working of an institution of learning. It might be urged as an argument in favor of the former, and against the latter, system, that one professor is inherently worth more than another; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page114" title="114"></span>and by the methods at present in vogue in making promotions this is true. But let no one be promoted to the rank of a full professorship in any one of our leading institutions of learning who does not measure up at least to a certain high minimum standard, and then let the salary received by a professor be determined by the years of service in his rank. If I may add a word of a general character in reference to university administration in this country, it would be: model our system as closely as possible, with the conditions existing in this country, after the German universities. Their present system of administration is the outgrowth of years, and in many cases of centuries, of experience. And what is the result? The finest system of higher education, beyond comparison, that the world has ever seen. Indeed, most of the productive men of science in this country, even to-day, have learned their lesson in the German universities, and transplanted research from Teutonic soil to this country. Such results as have been obtained in the German universities could scarcely have been reached under a system of administration that was seriously defective. It might be objected that the conditions in this country are fundamentally different with respect to higher education than those in Germany, and such an objection unfortunately contains a large element of truth. Nevertheless, we should profit by those greatest institutions of learning, adopting their system of administration as nearly as the existing conditions here will permit, and not learning the lesson of university administration all over again from the very beginning by experience. This is, I think, the real solution to the greatest problem in higher education in America to-day.</p>

    <p>Your proposals concerning the organization of universities are absolutely in line with my own hopes. Unless the working staff of the university gets a chance to help in the shaping of broader ideals of university life their interest will always be low. The superstition of one-man power is one of the worst impediments to a wider training of a spirit of collaboration, the lack of which makes public life as well as university life an opportunistic medley. It is deplorable that to-day the man who can enlist the cooperation of some financial magnates is a most forcible element<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page115" title="115"></span> in setting the pace in university policies. With regard to detail, I suppose the closer we keep to the English and Scotch pattern the more likely are we to reach the result, on account of the anti-German feeling existing in many quarters. This would mean the adoption of having a chancellor of the university, whereas, personally, I should prefer to have a rotation of the rectorship among the faculties, similar to what exists in the Swiss universities.</p>

    <p>I am in hearty sympathy with the underlying principles of your proposals. Taking them up separately: (1) The idea of a large corporation and of elective trustees is undoubtedly right. I think a chancellor essential. (2) The duties of the president are not given in your statement. It seems to me that the chairman of the senate might assume the responsibilities. (3) The idea of subdivision of the faculty into schools is right. I assume that in most universities the "college" would form a separate school. In which case the collegiate faculty should, of course, divide and meet at times with the members of the various other schools. (4) I believe in the financial and educational autonomy of the schools. But in regard to nominations of professors, I see no advantage in the "board of advisers"; I think the senate should have the final authority. I doubt the need of giving veto power to the board of trustees. Each school should have the duty of initiating plans for new professorships. There may be certain "standard" or minimum salaries; but I do not believe uniformity is possible or indeed advisable. (5) I would emphasize the duties of the senate, and would, I think, allow the board of trustees to appoint from the faculty a certain number of members. Certainly the membership should be small, less than twenty. The chairman, elected for one year, subject to the approval of the board of trustees, might well perform the so-called duties of the president. You do not make any definite proposal concerning means of contract with the alumni and the public. There should be, I think, an office charged with this duty. At its head should be a most capable man, not a member of the faculty, who might be also the secretary of the senate.</p>
